    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a> is one of the most significant sources of journalistic content on the entire internet. Of course, that depends on your definition of &ldquo;journalistic&rdquo;: BuzzFeed is one of the first organizations to leverage both social media and the power of language as an editorial business model.</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed_fb.png"></p>

<p>BuzzFeed has popularized the use of the &ldquo;listicle&rdquo; as <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/group-projects-should-be-wiped-off-the-face-o">seen above</a>: a bulleted list of text blurbs and/or photos that fits the length and depth of a normal blog article. Additionally, BuzzFeed was one of the first news sources to use non-neutral headlines that deliberately invoke a reaction in the reader which then subsequently tempts them to click on the article in an attempt to promote virality. These &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://mashable.com/2013/07/12/linkbait-content-marketing/">linkbait</a>&rdquo; techniques have been responsible for BuzzFeed receiving <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html">$50 million in venture capital</a>, and has spawned entire startups and job positions designed solely to emulate BuzzFeed&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>I decided to determine which phrases in BuzzFeed headlines are the most successful in order to see if it&rsquo;s possible to reverse-engineer BuzzFeed&rsquo;s business model. Therefore, I scraped BuzzFeed&rsquo;s website (<a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/buzzscrape/">after initial frustration</a>) and obtained 60,378 distinct articles and the corresponding number of Facebook Shares for each article. From there, I decomposed each headline into its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">component n-grams</a>, allowing me to perform quantitative analysis for each possible permutation of words in the article titles. You probably don&rsquo;t know that the 3 most interesting things I found will blow your mind.</p>

<h1>The Rise of the Listicle</h1>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed_listicle.png"></p>

<p>Listicles almost always begin with a numeral as the first or second word. Out of the 60,378 articles I obtained, 26% of them (15,656 articles) are listicles. BuzzFeed clearly believes they are successful, as the proportion of listicles to normal articles has increased over the years.</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-listicle-proportions.png"></p>

<p>Listicles can be of any size. The distibution of listicle sizes is centered at the median of 19 entries.</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-listicle-histogram.png"></p>

<p>Surprisingly, there is a positive correlation between listicle size and the number of Facebook shares it receives: A 30-size listicle receives many-multiples of shares more than 10-size listicles. (note the logarithmic scale for FB Shares)</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-listicle-scatterplot.png"></p>

<p>BuzzFeed has many different types of listicles to appeal to a wide crowd, including <em>[X] reasons</em>, <em>[X] books</em>, <em>[X] movies</em>, etc, where <em>[X]</em> is any 1 or 2-digit numeral. However, BuzzFeed&rsquo;s go-to listicle phrase has changed over the years. Here are the most-used listicle phrases for each month since 2012:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px; height: 300px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9SWJsmepYdb6YjWCFzM0gsuuDC5PBeFJZkTmJ568fs/pubhtml?gid=1424838564&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>


<p>In 2012 and 2013, BuzzFeed&rsquo;s listicles began with <em>the [X]</em>; in 2014, BuzzFeed&rsquo;s most-used listicles began with <em>[X] things</em>. The &ldquo;the&rdquo; is technically redundant; perhaps BuzzFeed decided to make the listicle schema cleaner and <em>less</em> formal. It may be possible that <em>[X] things</em> performs better on average than <em>the [X]</em>.</p>

<p>Which types of listicles are the most successful on Facebook? Which types of listicles receive the most amount of Facebook shares?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart of of the Top 30 types of listicles by the number of Facebook shares those articles have received on average (with a minimum of 50 articles of that listicle type):</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-shares-listicles.png"></p>

<p>A few notes on the chart: the gray bars on each average bar represent a <strong>95% confidence interval</strong> for the true value of each average, where the confidence interval is obtained through 10,000 iterations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29">bootstrap resampling</a>. The dashed vertical line represents the <strong>population average</strong> of all distinct BuzzFeed articles, at 6,657 Facebook shares, and helps visualize the relative impact of having these words in the title compared to a normal BuzzFeed article.</p>

<p>The most-posted listicle types mentioned above are <em>not</em> the types of listicles are most shared, however <em>[X] things</em> does indeed perform slightly better than <em>the [X]</em> on average. Emotional words, such as <em>insanely</em>, <em>awesome</em>, and <em>probably</em>, which you would never see in a more serious journalistic publication, are some of the key drivers of shares.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look into these keywords more to see if there are any other trends.</p>

<h1>Key Keywords</h1>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed_1gram.jpg"></p>

<p>Specific keywords may be more informative. Here&rsquo;s the most popular keywords over time, ignoring common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop words</a> and listicle words:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px; height: 300px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9SWJsmepYdb6YjWCFzM0gsuuDC5PBeFJZkTmJ568fs/pubhtml?gid=1106341985&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>


<p>Like most journalistic news sources, BuzzFeed tends to write more frequently toward then-current events. 2012 for example had many articles about the 2012 election, while April 2013 consisted of many articles about the Boston Marathon bombings.</p>

<p>Which keywords encouraged the most Facebook shares on average?</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-shares-1gram.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a more uncertainty in the accuracy of the average on keywords, especially with the #1 word, <em>career</em>. There&rsquo;s a strong focus on nostalgia, with <em>toys</em>, <em>childhood</em>, and <em>80s</em>. Certain brands (<em>potter</em> and <em>disney</em>) fit the nostalgia too.</p>

<p>High words with a relatively small confidence interval and <em>which</em> and <em>character</em>. These are likely caused by <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/quizzes">BuzzFeed&rsquo;s quizzes</a>, which have been incredibly popular. Analyzing full phrases is necessary to get a bigger picture.</p>

<h1>3-Word Phrases</h1>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed_3gram.png"></p>

<p>After careful analysis, I found that 3-word phrases (trigrams) provided more helpful information than phrases of other lengths. Over time, there are similarities with the popular phrases; they both relate to then-current event and occasionally contain listicles.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px; height: 300px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9SWJsmepYdb6YjWCFzM0gsuuDC5PBeFJZkTmJ568fs/pubhtml?gid=249061324&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>


<p>The average shares of articles based on phrases in their titles, however, tell the full story.</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-shares-3gram-v2.png"></p>

<p>Now we can clearly see some the infamous phrases traditionally associated with clickbait.</p>

<p>Indeed, <em>character are you</em>, a frequent phrase in quizzes, is what leads to the most virality. (It&rsquo;s worth nothing that these perform 3-4 times better than the best listicles on average). Likewise, you may notice a few phrases are redundant and subset of a bigger phrase (e.g. <em>things you probably</em>, <em>you probably don&rsquo;t</em>, <em>probably don&rsquo;t know</em>), but since the averages FB shares aren&rsquo;t identical, it&rsquo;s not a perfect subset, and therefore the average is relevant. There&rsquo;s also a frequent appeal to <em>you</em>, the reader, with <em>you/your/you&rsquo;re</em> appearing in about half of the top phrases.</p>

<p>Does clickbait work? Of course it does. Granted, there has been a lot of disenchantment with the rise of clickbait; that&rsquo;s why the parody Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/SavedYouAClick">@SavedYouAClick</a> was created and hit 182K followers in months. It&rsquo;s also the reason why <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/08/news-feed-fyi-click-baiting/">Facebook will now be punishing clickbait</a> and making them less public in a user&rsquo;s news feed, which will definitely hurt BuzzFeed. That&rsquo;s likely one of the reasons why they are pivoting to quizzes and video content instead.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect clickbait to disappear anytime soon; it&rsquo;s easy and provides a good return-on-investment, both of which are important to scrappy websites trying to market on social media. Or things could come full-circle and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/photos-that-prove-game-of-thrones-happened-in-real-life">BuzzFeed could publish clickbait about making the best clickbait</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Locating All the Christmas Trees on Instagram]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2015/01/tree-time/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-01T09:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2015/01/tree-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone enjoys taking photos of their Christmas trees, usually at their own home of their relatives. <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> allows users to quickly upload any photo and share it socially to the world. On Christmas Eve, privacy author Tommy Collison <a href="http://www.tommycollison.com/blog/2014/12/24/christmas-geotagging">published a warning about this behavior</a>, noting that if a user tags a photo with #tree to tag their Christmas tree, for example, <em>anyone</em> will be able to see it, and if the user attached their location to the photo, anyone could theoretically find where they live.</p>

<p>How practical is this concern? Instagram <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">offers an API</a> of all recent photos for a given #tag so developers can download pictures and their corresponding metadata, such as geolocation, in bulk. (Up to <em>165,000</em> Instagram images can be processed per hour!)</p>

<p>I downloaded <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of #tree images and found 25,432 images which were taken on Christmas, have a #tree, and, most importantly, contain location data where the photo was taken. From that, I created an <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1J3RQB6MuFbZvA_WcCVHlKAzDBUppxFBQ3LA054RL">interactive map</a> showing the location of all these images worldwide using <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en">Google Fusion Tables</a>. You can click-and-drag to move the map all over the world, and you can click on a marker on the map to see the Instagram image taken at that location! (note that if you&rsquo;re on a mobile device, the embedded map may work better on a desktop browser)</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col8+from+1J3RQB6MuFbZvA_WcCVHlKAzDBUppxFBQ3LA054RL&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=50.13422309020635&amp;lng=-46.22345629918755&amp;t=1&amp;z=3&amp;l=col8&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=3&amp;hml=TWO_COL_LAT_LNG"></iframe>


<p>I found a few interesting things while playing with this map.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-tree"></i> Christmas Trees in the USA</h1>

<p>A downside of the interactive map is that quantifying the relative number of photos between dense areas (e.g. cities) can be misleading as the opaque markers overlap. Here is a static map of all of the Instagram photos in the United States, with each translucent point representing an image:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/instagram_treemap_state.png"></p>

<p>The number of photos is densest near the large cities, which is what you would expect.</p>

<p>A way to calculate the relative proportion of the number of #tree photos between states is to use a type of chart known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">treemap</a> (pun <em>very</em> much intended).</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/treemap-state.png"></p>

<p>In this treemap, the relative area of each block corresponds to the number of photos taken in the state; therefore, the combination of all the blocks represents 100% of the #tree photos taken in the USA. If two blocks are the same size (e.g. New York and Florida), then they have the same number of #tree photos.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed from these two charts, these data represented by these two charts is approximately the same as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population">population density in the United States</a>. Although this touches on the <a href="http://xkcd.com/1138/">infamous statistical problem</a> of heat maps resembling population maps, in this case, it&rsquo;s what would be expected.</p>

<p>Looking at all the #tree photos in the world may tell a different story.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Christmas Trees in the World</h1>

<p>Christmas is a holiday for only one religion with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_by_country">low presence in Asia and northern Africa</a>, so it would be expected that the locations of Christmas trees worldwide do <em>not</em> correlate with population, which makes the analysis more interesting.</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/instagram_world_map.png"></p>

<p>The prevalence of Christmas trees is most prominent in the United States and Europe, with relatively few in Asia, where the majority of the world&rsquo;s population is located. Italy has Christmas trees <em>uniformly</em> throughout the entire country, which is an interesting behavior.</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/treemap-world.png"></p>

<p>The treemap confirms that Asian and African countries like China, India, and Nigeria do not have as many Christmas trees than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">what their large populations would suggest</a>. Italy, however has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Italy">population of 60 million</a> (the same as the United Kingdom) which is about 1/5th of the population of United States; the fact that Italy has more than half of the number of Christmas Trees than the United States is very unusual and should be questioned.</p>

<p>Italy <em>may</em> have a high number of Christmas trees since Vatican City is the seat of the papacy, but perhaps data <em>itself</em> should be questioned too.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> &ldquo;Christmas Trees&rdquo; in the World</h1>

<p>If you check the photos in Italy, you many notice that many of them have a photo caption similar to this one:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/christmas_tagsforlikes.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s obviously no Christmas tree in that photo. But there are a <em>lot</em> of tags.</p>

<p>Many Instagram photos use a service called <a href="http://www.tagsforlikes.com/">TagsForLikes</a>, which complies a list of popular hashtags that other users are able to see. Users can then then copy/paste them into the photo caption to spam hashtags increase the photo exposure, which, as I&rsquo;ve shown <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/03/hashtag-tag/">in a previous blog post</a>, does in fact increase the number of Likes the photo receives from other users.</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/tags4likes.png"></p>

<p>Notice a resemblance between this list and the photo caption?</p>

<p>Fortunately, all the TagsForLikes hashtag lists contain #TagsForLikes as a branding trick, which makes such photos extremely easy to detect. Here&rsquo;s what the world map looks like if all the potentially spam photos were colored red:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/instagram_world_spamnonspam.png"></p>

<p>Italy looks a <em>lot</em> different now! There is red in other counties, but it&rsquo;s not easily visible at a glance.</p>

<p>The treemap of photos, when seperated between spam and non-spam photos, tells the full story:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/treemap-spam-nonspam.png"></p>

<p>About 20% of all the #tree photos are spam photos, and about half of those were taken by people in Italy. As a result, Italy has <em>more spam #tree photos than nonspam #tree photos!</em> This is an interesting cultural phenomenon that I have no guesses as to why it occurs. All other countries have significantly smaller numbers of spam photos relatively non-spam photos.</p>

<p>For non-spam photos, the number of #tree photos in Italy now matches the number of non-spam photos in the UK, which correlates with their populations, making the removal of spam photos a sane move.</p>

<p>Is it possible to track people in their homes via Instagram tags? Definitely. If you do care privacy and your Instagram account is not set to Private, I recommend not geotagging your photos. If you&rsquo;re interested in looking at such photos,  ensure that the the tag is relevant for the given photo.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A Statistical Analysis of 142 Million Reddit Submissions]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/12/reddit-statistics/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-16T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/12/reddit-statistics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/reddit_logo.jpg"></p>

<p>Reddit, the &ldquo;front page of the Internet&rdquo;, is well-deserving of that title. Founded in 2005 for the more tech-savvy crowd, <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> is a news aggregator where users can submit links to interesting websites and other media, and form communities on specific interests which are known as &ldquo;subreddits.&rdquo; Since 2008, its popularity has grown exponentially.</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/all_cumsub_reddit.png"></p>

<p>More impressively, the number of new submissions each month to Reddit increases, with slight declines offset by large gains in the next month.</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/growth_rate_reddit.png"></p>

<p>Although Reddit first launched in 2005, it didn&rsquo;t hit mainstream until much later. At first, Reddit was at peace. But everything changed when the Digg Nation attacked.  <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>, which was the leading news aggregator at the time, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/03/digg-redesign-social-web/">announced a redesign in March 2010</a> which rolled out that summer. The redesign was profit-maximizing, which massively irritated Digg&rsquo;s userbase. The majority of these users ended up flocking to Reddit, drastically changing its userbase and affecting Reddit&rsquo;s submissions as a whole. As a result, it&rsquo;s required to look at Reddit&rsquo;s entire history if possible when analyzing any statistical analysis of it. (although, as a warning, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">correlation does not imply causation</a>).</p>

<p>I, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/minimaxir">/u/minimaxir</a>, have personally been a redditor for 3 years. I&rsquo;ve previously done statistical analyses of Reddit data before, such as looking at which <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/subreddit-size/">subreddits are the largest</a> or determining which sites on Reddit are <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/09/reddit-imgur-youtube/">the most-frequently submitted</a>, but those were written with incomplete data. Thanks to <a href="http://redditanalytics.com">Reddit Analytics</a>, I have obtained a data dump and I subsequently constructed a database to store all Reddit Submissions from November 2007 to the end of October 2014: 142,159,793 submissions in total. And this data is very curious and very, <em>very</em> memetic.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-reddit"></i> A Quick Glance At Reddit</h1>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/reddit_sample.png"></p>

<p>Reddit ranks submissions through a combination of upvotes from users, downvotes, and age of submission. The average score of a submission, which is the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes, has changed throughout the years.</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/all_score_reddit.png"></p>

<p>The average score of a submission was relatively constant until the Digg announcement, then it started to increase, as the number of potential upvoters for a submission also increased. Interestingly the score, has decreased in recent months; it is entirely possible that the average is decreasing due to an increase in low-scoring posts.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the average scores of Top 100 subreddits by submission volume to see which are the most well-received.</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/top_score_reddit.png"></p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: The shaded areas in charts for this article represent 95% percent confidence intervals for the true average of a given month/subreddit. Since there is a </em>lot<em> of submission data, the confidence intervals are usually incredibly narrow.</em></p>

<p>Image subreddits, such as <a href="http://reddit.com/r/gifs">/r/gifs</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/cringepics">/r/cringepics</a>, and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/reactiongifs">/r/reactiongifs</a> are clearly the most well-received on Reddit. (I plan to do a more in-depth analysis of this behavior in another blog post).</p>

<p>Users can also leave comments on submissions to add insight and jokes. How has the Digg announcement affected the number of comments?</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/all_comments_reddit.png"></p>

<p>As it turns out, there&rsquo;s a <em>very</em> significant change in the average number of comments pre and post-Digg announcement. From April 2010 to August 2010, the average number of comments increased from 4.79 to 7.91, nearly doubling the number of comments in less than half a year.</p>

<p>Many top subreddits encourage more discussion than others.</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/top_comments_reddit.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/IAmA">/r/IAmA</a> is Reddit&rsquo;s flagship subreddit (which <a href="http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/announcing-official-reddit-ama-app_2.html">has its own official app</a>!), where users can ask questions to noteworthy people: it&rsquo;s not surprising to see it far at the top. Sports and video games are the top topics for discussion on Reddit.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-comments"></i> reddit.self</h1>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/reddit_self.png"></p>

<p>An alternate form on Reddit is the self-post, where the user submits text instead of a link to an external website or image. These posts are used to make announcements and encourage discussion on a specific topic. Some large subreddits have even switched to &ldquo;self-post only&rdquo; mode.</p>

<p>The popularity of self-posts has risen significantly over the year, and new submissions of self-posts now account for nearly half of all the new submissions on Reddit! (45.3% in October 2014)</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/self_proportion_reddit.png"></p>

<p>In theory, self-posts make subreddits contain higher-quality content. How do the scores of self-posts compare to that of normal posts?</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/self_score_reddit.png"></p>

<p>Before the Digg announcement, self-submissions were more noteworthy than regular submissions. Afterwards, self submissions receive about &frac14;th of the score of a normal submission on average. This is likely related to the substantial increase in self posts seen above: the rise of self-posts also leads to a rise in low-quality self-posts, which will reduce the average.</p>

<p>But have the self-posts succeeded in encouraging more discussion on posts?</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/self_comments_reddit.png"></p>

<p>Yes. They have. Despite having &frac14;th of the score, self-submissions receive about twice as many comments on average.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-ban"></i> Not Safe For Procrastinating At Work</h1>

<p><em>[Sample image omitted for obvious reasons.]</em></p>

<p>Reddit has received an infamous reputation for being the internet&rsquo;s primary source of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) images and links with an age limit of 18+. Not all of the content is sexual; occasionally, shockingly violent yet important images are submitted to the primary subreddits as well.</p>

<p>The proportion of new NSFW content submitted to Reddit each month has increased gradually over the years, but it&rsquo;s still in the minority of submissions. (7.5% of all submissions in October 2014)</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/nsfw_proportion_reddit.png"></p>

<p>If the proportion of NSFW content is relatively low, then how has it achieved such a reputation? How well does NSFW content score relative to non-NSFW content?</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/nsfw_score_reddit.png"></p>

<p>NSFW content scores are nearly double that of non-NSFW content. Higher community approval of sexual content as opposed to nonsexual content isn&rsquo;t too surprising.</p>

<p>Reddit&rsquo;s community operates on pseudonyms instead of tying users to a real identity. Do users comment on NSFW submissions as often as normal submissions?</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/nsfw_comments_reddit.png"></p>

<p>The number of comments on NSFW submissions is only slightly less than that on average, but there&rsquo;s a larger amount of uncertainty for that particular average due to the smaller proportion. Most internet users are lurkers and not contributors; it&rsquo;s likely that NSFW media is a more noninteractive experience. (<em>ahem</em>)</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Reddit In The City</h1>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/reddit_sf.png"></p>

<p>Reddit users visit the site from all over the world. Although we cannot determine the location from where a user makes a submission, we can look at subreddits whose primary focus is a given location to see if there are any geographic trends.</p>

<p>I took a list of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/comments/joqru/a_list_of_the_most_popular_city_reddits/">most popular city subreddits</a>, such as <a href="http://reddit.com/r/toronto">/r/toronto</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco">/r/sanfrancisco</a> and compared the average score of their submissions.</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/city_score_reddit.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/Seattle">/r/Seattle</a> has an unusually high average score of 24.7 per submission and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/montreal">/r/montreal</a> has an unusually low average score of 10.7. There does not be any clear geographic trends in the data: <a href="http://reddit.com/r/losangeles">/r/losangeles</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/bayarea">/r/bayarea</a> are at the top but <a href="http://reddit.com/r/sandiego">/r/sandiego</a> is at the bottom, plus <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Dallas">/r/Dallas</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Austin">/r/Austin</a> are on the opposite areas of the chart too. As a Pennsylvania native, I find it funny that <a href="http://reddit.com/r/pittsburgh">/r/pittsburgh</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/philadelphia">/r/philadelphia</a> are next to each other.</p>

<p>Are the average number of comments affected by geography?</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/city_comments_reddit.png"></p>

<p>There are a few more parings here than with average scores: <a href="http://reddit.com/r/montreal">/r/montreal</a>  and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/toronto">/r/toronto</a> are paired as non-US cities, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Portland">/r/Portland</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Seattle">/r/Seattle</a> are paired as West Coast cities, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Austin">/r/Austin</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/houston">/r/houston</a> are paired as Texas cities, and all of <a href="http://reddit.com/r/bayarea">/r/bayarea</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco">/r/sanfrancisco</a>, and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/sandiego">/r/sandiego</a> are paired as California cities. It&rsquo;s still not a perfect relationship, however.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-meh-o"></i> Positivity and Negativity</h1>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/reddit_neg.png"></p>

<p>Reddit also has a reputation of being both positive and negative. You have communities like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww">/r/aww</a> which share cute cat photos, and then you have communities like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which&hellip;don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I took the top 100 subreddits by # of all-time submissions and found which ones were the most positive and negative. This was calculated by comparing each word of the submission title against a lexicon of positive/negative words, and count the number of review words in the lexicon. In this case, I use the lexicons compiled by <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html">UIC professor Bing Liu</a>. A normalized positivity/negativity score is calculated by taking the average number of positive/negative words for the subreddit and dividing it by the average number of words in titles for submissions to the subreddit.</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/all_sentiment_reddit.png"></p>

<p>Both positivity and negativity have been pretty equal for Reddit&rsquo;s entirety, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Reddit is neutral.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the most positive of the top Reddit communities:</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/reddit_subreddit_positivity.png"></p>

<p>The top communities are the communities which rely on community and general good feelings (this includes /r/nsfw, <em>ahem</em>). <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cookingrecipesstuff">/r/CookingRecipesStuff</a> has the greatest positivity because it&rsquo;s apparently run by a spammer who sent enough submissions to become one the Top 100 subreddits by trying to abuse Reddit for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink">SEO backlinks</a>.</p>

<p>Huh, that wasn&rsquo;t expected.</p>

<p>The most negative subreddits are more intuitive.</p>

<p><img src="/img/reddit-statistics/reddit_subreddit_negativity.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu">/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a> were subreddits designed for ranting so negativity is expected. Many news subreddits have a high negativity (and comparatively little positivity). The presence of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Health">/r/Health</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport">/r/techsupport</a> as negative subreddits is appropriate.</p>

<p>This article is only <em>scratching the surface</em> of the information contained in Reddit&rsquo;s history, and I hope to explore more in the future. The Digg redesign announcement is only one of many events in Reddit&rsquo;s history, and there are still other aspects of self posts, NSFW submissions, and city subreddits that make me want to take a closer look. Reddit has been a primary source for images and video which go viral around the web, and unlocking that information may just help understand <em>how</em> things go viral.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/10/hn-comments-about-comments/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-06T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/10/hn-comments-about-comments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last February, I <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/hacking-hacker-news/">published an article</a> about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, a tech-oriented link aggregator run by startup accelerator <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>. In that post, I analyzed all submissions to date, and noted that the site has a strong and active userbase.</p>

<p>In recent months, however, Hacker News has undergone criticism. A blog post by Danilo Campos titled &ldquo;<a href="http://danilocampos.com/2014/09/y-combinator-and-the-negative-externalities-of-hacker-news/">Y Combinator and the negative externalities of Hacker News</a>&rdquo;, notes that although Hacker News is a critical resource for young male techies based in Silicon Valley (<em>Disclosure: I am a young male techie based in Silicon Valley</em>), this has the consequence of excluding female hackers. Campos has even created a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23hnwatch&amp;src=typd">#HNwatch</a> hashtag to catalog sexist and insensitive comments made by Hacker News users. As a long-time <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir">user on Hacker News</a>, I unfortunately <a href="https://twitter.com/minimaxir/status/468080907925340160">agree with this assessment</a> at times.</p>

<p>In fairness, such comments are in the minority on Hacker News. Or are they?</p>

<p>In order to better assess the quality, popularity, and negativity of Hacker News comments over the years, I&rsquo;ve downloaded 5,592,362 comments from Hacker News, the maximum number of comments possible, from its beginnings in 2006 to October 2014. Hopefully, these comments will answer whether Hacker News is experiencing a rise in quality, or if the complaints levied against HN are valid.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwonVX_KlDYhuhPnAAnVpdVRgu4LxldP74-c_kvOd5k/edit?usp=sharing">glance at Hacker News&rsquo;s best comments</a>, determined by the number of upvotes it receives from the Hacker News community, for each month since 2006:</p>

<div><iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwonVX_KlDYhuhPnAAnVpdVRgu4LxldP74-c_kvOd5k/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></div>


<p>There are interesting trends in this sample data set. The types of comments that became popular in 2006-2008 Hacker News were one-line quips, akin to those you would see in the comments on modern Reddit (which is a topic for another blog post). Highly-voted comments often come from the same people, especially those from Paul Graham (pg), Founder and then-President of Y Combinator.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/early_reddit.png"></p>

<p>This may indicate a bias or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">halo effect</a> where the commenter is more impactful than the comment itself. Additionally, some comments received many upvotes due to context: the top comment in December 2010 was simply &ldquo;sad.&rdquo; in a thread about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2013248">Yahoo Shutting Down Delicious</a>, but the comment was made by Joshua Schachter (joshu), the creator of Delicious.</p>

<p>Compare those older comments to those made between 2012-2014. Those comments are very long, insightful, and made by many different people. (including a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4689643">comment by Danilo Campos himself</a> in October 2012)</p>

<p>However, these are the good comments. The bad comments are <em>especially</em> bad.</p>

<p>Here are a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfbSDYVBXiHZCuMdHXgprhmeCVc4XDtOGizF9CSGyUo/edit?usp=sharing">set of Hacker News&rsquo;s worst comments</a> from each month where the comment has received a score of -3 or -4, the lowest score before the comment is automatically killed. (<em>Warning: comments may cause you to lose faith in humanity and/or be unintentionally hilarious</em>)</p>

<div><iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfbSDYVBXiHZCuMdHXgprhmeCVc4XDtOGizF9CSGyUo/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></div>


<p>The types of bad comments haven&rsquo;t changed over the years. Hostile comments are immediately downvoted. It&rsquo;s worth noting that on Hacker News, you can be downvoted for being factually wrong.</p>

<p>Some users are more active commenters than others. Out of Hacker News&rsquo;s 176,692 users who have made atleast 1 comment, only 48% of those commenters end up leaving two more comments, and only 6% of HN users end up leaving 100 or more comments total.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/n-comments.png"></p>

<p>However, as users comment more on Hacker News and learn the intricacies of HN&rsquo;s culture, they become more skilled at creating quality comments which receive higher scores, which serve as an indicator of quality. As Hacker News users comment more and more, the average expected comment score for each successive post increases.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/n-comments-practice.png"></p>

<p><em>(The faded area for all charts in this article represents a 95% confidence interval for the average at a given point; all of the confidence intervals are very narrow due to the sheer quantity of data present. Whoo, big data!)</em></p>

<p>What are the trends behind the Hacker News comments? First, we must see how Hacker News comments has changed over time.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i></span> Hacking Through The Years</h1>

<p>As one would expect, the number of new comments posted on Hacker News each month has been gradually increasing proportional to its popularity, although the number of new comments per month has decreased starting in 2014, which indicates a slowing growth rate.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/monthly_total_comments.png"></p>

<p>However, has Hacker News retained quality with its increasing notoriety? One way to check is to analyze the average amount of points of the comments. Hacker News comments start out at 1 point, and other users can upvote and downvote comments.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/monthly_average_points.png"></p>

<p>The minimum average points score of any given comment was about 2 points, meaning that all comments received atleast 1 upvote on average. This trend has been increasing until 2011 when it peaked at about 4.5 points. Since then, the average has trended downward, with a particularly large drop starting at 2014.</p>

<p>Therefore, starting in 2014, both quantity <em>and</em> quality are on a downward trend.</p>

<p>Another way to gauge quality is to look at the average comment length. Are comments trending toward short quips, or are longform comments more popular?</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/monthly_average_words.png"></p>

<p>The length of the average comment has increased by about 10% over the years, which shows a slight increase in the overall thoughtfulness of HN comments.</p>

<p>Has the average sentiment on Hacker News changed over the years? To gauge the relative sentiment of Hacker News comments, I compared each word of the comment against a lexicon of positive/negative words, and counted the number of review words in the lexicon. In this case, I used the <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html">lexicons compiled by UIC professor Bing Liu</a>. This is the same method used in my <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/one-star-five-stars/">previous analysis of Yelp reviews</a>, where the technique was very effective. However, unlike Yelp, comments on Hacker News tend to make use of sarcasm, so this method may be less effective. (there isn&rsquo;t any easy method for detecting sarcasm, because who in the entire world would want an easy method for detecting sarcasm?)</p>

<p>From that, we can calculate average positivity and average negativity for a given comment by dividing the number of positive/negative words respectively by the approximate number of words in the comment. Both metrics have converged slightly over the years.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/monthly_average_positive_negative.png"></p>

<p>In September 2014, the average positivity of a comment is <em>3.2%</em>, while the average negativity of a comment is <em>2.3%</em> (leading to a 0.9% net positive sentiment).</p>

<p>The nature of the comments Hacker News has definitely changed since the site&rsquo;s humble beginnings in 2006, but it&rsquo;s hard to determine if it&rsquo;s for the <em>better</em>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look more into the nature of the upvote system.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></span> Free Points</h1>

<p>As mentioned, the number of points on a new Hacker News comment starts at 1 point. Anyone can give an upvote, which increases the points value by one. However, long-time HN users can downvote posts, decreasing the score by 1. Downvoting has another effect; comments with 0 or fewer points turn an aesthetically-displeasing gray, in an effort to both hide them from the public eye and encourage corrective upvotes if necessary from users with OCD. In all other cases, the points score of a comment is hidden from other users in order to help prevent bandwagoning and the upvoting of comments just because they have lots of upvotes.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/distribution_comment_points.png"></p>

<p>Over 50% of all comments simply have 1 or 2 points, with the proportion decreasing by a third for each successive point value. What&rsquo;s surprising is how few comments have 0 or fewer points: this shows that HN users do not like downvoting.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that comment length could be used a proxy for comment quality. Is there a relationship between the number of points a comment receives and the length of a comment?</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/distribution_comment_points_words.png"></p>

<p>Surprisingly, yes! The effect of comment length on the number of points a comment received is likely not solely causal, but the correlation between the two values is helpful. (it is statistically unlikely to receive a lot of upvotes if your comment is short. The inverse is also true; a short comment is much more likely get downvoted.)</p>

<p>Is there a similar correlation between sentiment and the number of points a comment receives?</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/distribution_comment_points_sentiment.png"></p>

<p>Nope. Both positivity and negativity are relatively static regardless of point values, although it&rsquo;s worth noting that comments with 0 or fewer points (downvoted comments) have a disproportionately high negativity.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-ban"></i></span> Tone and Tolerance on Hacker News</h1>

<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference between the language used in a Hacker News comment on a typical submission, and the language used in Hacker News submissions about women and diversity.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/hn_2_gram_small.jpg"></p>

<p>This word cloud consists of bigrams made from 109k comments from HN submissions in September 2014, and from 21k comments in threads whose submission title contains &ldquo;women&rdquo;, &ldquo;female,&rdquo; or &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; The language in the former is more neutral and about the content of the article (apparently Hacker News users <em>really</em> like to talk about Open Source software), while the submissions about gender and diversity trend to talk about tangent topics.</p>

<p>How does the tone differ between the two groups of articles? Here&rsquo;s the distribution of the average number of positive words in comments per submission in September 2014:</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/density_september_2014_hn.png"></p>

<p>The average amount of positive words in a comment made in September 2014 is 2.16 words, and the average amount of negative words is 1.46, with both of those values being close to the respective statistical modes.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare that to the distribution of comments made on all submissions about women and diversity.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hn-comments/density_women.png"></p>

<p>The average amount of positive words in a comment made in thread about gender and diversity is 2.48 words, a little higher than the average, and is also the most frequently occuring value. However, The average amount of positive words in a comment made in thread about gender and diversity is 2.10 words, a much higher increase. The average is to the right of the mode, indicating that the average is skewed-right by submissions with overly-negative comments. This may be why there is a greater perception of negativity for readers of comment threads about women and diversity.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hackernews.html">stated goals of Hacker News</a> is to avoid an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a>, where the quality of discourse drops and everyone leaves. It&rsquo;s clear that the quality of discourse has changed over the years: comments are longer, but not necessarily better. Positivity has decreased and negativity has increased. The difference between 2006 HN and 2014 HN is stark.</p>

<p>Hacker News isn&rsquo;t the perfect tech news aggregator. The issue of inclusion is real, and despite the fact that sexist comments are in the minority, they need to stop. In 2014, both quantity <em>and</em> quality are decreasing. But since that Y Combinator has <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/diversity-and-startups">committed to ending sexism in tech</a> and <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/meet-the-people-taking-over-hacker-news">appointed new moderators</a> to control content quality, I&rsquo;m confident that things will improve in the future for Hacker News.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The Least Effective Method For Blocking Web Scraping of a Website]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/buzzscrape/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-26T10:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/buzzscrape</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who typically plays around with data from public website APIs, I figured it would be worthwhile to learn how to get data from websites the old-fashioned way: through force, via web scraping. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">Web scraping</a> is a technique where the user downloads the raw HTML of a webpage, and parses the inherent structure of the webpage to extract the necessary data.</p>

<p>In order to understand the mechanics behind web scraping, I used a tool from new Y Combinator startup <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>, which allows the user to click structured elements of any website and quickly create an API that can access all the collected data and convert it into an easy-to-access form. My first target was BuzzFeed, since their social interaction data might be useful in determining how it became so big so quickly, and maybe also determine just how effective those stupid listicles are.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i></span> Live Free and Scrape Hard</h1>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a pair of typical BuzzFeed articles:</p>

<p><img src="/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_example.png"></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the corresponding output of <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/apis/1x3l57k0">my Kimono Labs BuzzFeed scraper</a> for those two articles:</p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='html'>{&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &quot;title&quot;: {
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Stop Tweeting Instagram Links&quot;,
      &quot;href&quot;: &quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/stop-tweeting-instagram-links&quot;
    },
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I CANNOT REMAIN SILENT ON THIS ISSUE ANY LONGER.&quot;,
    &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Katie Notopoulos&quot;,
    &quot;num_responses&quot;: &quot;123&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;title&quot;: {
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;28 Things Your Gchat Availability Status Really Means&quot;,
      &quot;href&quot;: &quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/28-things-your-gchat-availability-status-really-means&quot;
    },
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Let’s chat.&quot;,
    &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Katie Heaney&quot;,
    &quot;num_responses&quot;: &quot;13&quot;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>This data format (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>) can be processed and manipulated by nearly any modern programming language.</p>

<p>Each BuzzFeed category page has about 22 articles, but the scraper can also access successive pages to retrieve more articles. This works by finding the URL of the next page by deriving the URL from the &ldquo;Older&rdquo; button if present on that page. Then the scraper can find the Older button on the page after that, and so forth, until all pages on BuzzFeed are scraped.</p>

<p><img src="/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_page.png"></p>

<p>My BuzzFeed scraper, for some reason, only retrieved 10 pages maximum. So I used my QA skills and traced the exact route the scraper took, navigating through all 10 pages by clicking the Older button.</p>

<p>What was on Page #10 shocked me. OMG. I could not believe my eyes.</p>

<p><img src="/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_disable.png"></p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-times-circle-o"></i></span> No Scrape For You</h1>

<p>The Older button is <em>disabled</em> on page 10? <strong>WHY?</strong></p>

<p>BuzzFeed is a website created in the 21st century that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html?_r=0">just raised $50 million</a>. This is not a peculiar technical limitation due to bad coding or bad infrastructure; this is a deliberate functional aspect of the product.</p>

<p>It is my personal mantra that if a startup has a particularly unintuitive UI/UX behavior, it&rsquo;s a form of &ldquo;growth hacking&rdquo; that my feeble brain cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>Could the reason that BuzzFeed disables access to pages past 10 is that they want to prevent archive browsing, thereby putting more of an emphasis on more recent and more potentially-viral articles? That wouldn&rsquo;t make sense; if a person is so hooked on BuzzFeed articles that they are at Page 10, why stop them? It&rsquo;s still free page views and ad revenue.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s likely that BuzzFeed has statistics on how many users actually visit article pages up to Page 10. Perhaps their data analysts noted &ldquo;hey, only 0.0027% of our visitors actually read up to Page 10, anyone who actually reads that far is three standard deviations away from normal, therefore they must be a web scraper!&rdquo; and recommend punitive action accordingly.</p>

<p>I noted earlier that it definitely was not a technical limitation that kept pages greater than 10 from being accessed. If you look at the URLs of the BuzzFeed screenshots above, you&rsquo;ll notice a &ldquo;<em>p=2</em>&rdquo; parameter for Page 2 or a &ldquo;<em>p=10</em>&rdquo; parameter for Page 10. What happens if you just change the 10 to a 11?</p>

<p>You go to Page 11. And you can go all the way to page <em>200</em> in some categories.</p>

<p><img src="/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_200.png"></p>

<p>Incidentally, this is easier and more reliable to implement programmatically than searching for the Older button and extracting the URL.</p>

<p>So the disabling of the button will only stop stupid web scrapers. Yes, that makes my BuzzFeed web scraper a stupid web scraper, <em>but that&rsquo;s not the point!</em> It just makes the BuzzFeed&rsquo;s motive behind disabling the button at Page 10  even more baffling.</p>

<p>What did I do now that my quick-and-dirty BuzzFeed scraper couldn&rsquo;t parse a statistically significant amount of BuzzFeed articles? I did the only logical thing.</p>

And I even was able to add new features to the scraper, such as simultaneously scraping the number of Facebook Shares a given BuzzFeed article generates.</p>
