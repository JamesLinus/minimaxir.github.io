    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on a blog post on how the rise of smartphones and tablets impacts the design of charts and other data visualizations. In the process, I took a look at the proportion of mobile devices, tablets, and desktops which have visited my blog over time, using <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, in order to quantify the importance of catering to these newer technologies.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portrait/minimaxir_devices.png"></p>

<p>After looking at 781,557 visitors to minimaxir.com from January 2013 to February 2015, the proportion of mobile devices + tablets has been slightly increasing, and together consist of more than &frac14;th of the views to my blog, so catering to these users is not unimportant.</p>

<p>Another important concern is <em>how</em> visitors view my blog on smartphones/tablets. Do they read holding their device in <strong>portrait</strong> mode, where the device is vertically-oriented and supports one-handed use, or do they read the web using their device in <strong>landscape</strong> mode, where the device is horizontally-oriented and allows for more text per line? Almost every desktop monitor is landscape, so worrying about that is effectively a non-issue.</p>

<p>Google Analytics also records the screen resolution of each browser which visits my website (for example, an iPhone 5/5S user in portrait mode will appear as a <em>mobile</em> device with a effective resolution of <em>320x568</em>. Note that the true device resolution is <em>640x1136</em>; for many modern smartphones, the web content renders at twice the DPI to fit the entire screen). From that, I can infer that the user has their device in portrait mode if the screen height is greater than the screen width, and vice versa for landscape.</p>

<p>After breaking it down by device category, I found something unexpected.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portrait/minimaxir_orientation.png"></p>

<p>95.25% of all smartphones browse the web in portrait orientation, while 88.18% of all tablets browse the web in portrait. I was expecting the proportion of portrait mode users to be high, but not <em>that</em> high! *</p>

<p>But what does this mean in terms of website design?</p>

<h1>Implications</h1>

<p>Modern front-end website themes and frameworks advocate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive design</a>, where the website resizes and adjusts elements in order to fit the screen resolution of the device (my website uses the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap framework</a>, which was one of the first to popularize responsive design) However, there is programming, design, and QA overhead necessary to support each and every possible device width, from the tiniest portrait smartphones to the wide 1080p monitors used on desktops. As a result, many older websites do not care to invest the time and money to optimize for responsive design, but as my first chart shows, the proportion of tablets and smartphones is nontrivial, and therefore there&rsquo;s a strong incentive for catering to them.</p>

<p>Bootstrap has a maximum width of 1200px; any screen width less than that will be impacted by responsive design. Let&rsquo;s look at the distibution of device widths, by device category.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portrait/minimaxir_devices_all.png"></p>

<p>The median browser width is 1366px, corresponding to the device resolution of 1366x768, which is a common &ldquo;720p&rdquo; resolution on laptops. Half of the visitors will have a screen width greater than 1366px, and therefore they would not benefit from a responsive layout. Inversely, half of the visitors will have a device width below 1366px, and most of those are not desktops and below the 1200px limit and therefore will be impacted by responsive design.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the same chart, but colored by device orientation instead of category.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portrait/minimaxir_orientations_all.png"></p>

<p>The majority of the devices below the median are portrait devices, which isn&rsquo;t surprising, but is evident that portrait mode is a concern.</p>

<p>We can further separate these groups in 6 subgroups: one for each device category and orientation combination. This tells the full story.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portrait/minimaxir_widths.png"></p>

<p>Mobile Portrait devices have over 75% of the widths concentrated at about 360px (the effective width of Samsung Galaxy smartphones), while Tablet Portrait devices have over 75% of the widths concentrated at about 768px (the effective width of iPads). In contrast, Landscape smartphones, tablets, and desktops encompass a wider variety of device widths.</p>

<p>Not only do most smartphones view the web in portrait, the effective widths of these smartphones and tablets are centered around specific widths. This makes targeting certain device widths an effective strategy for saving time when testing mobile-optimized content, especially when working with data visualizations.</p>

<hr />

<p>*In fairness, the viewers on my website about technology and statistics may not necessarily represent the viewers on the internet as a whole. However, it&rsquo;s fair to assume that the way a person holds a device is uncorrelated with the person&rsquo;s topic preferences. Additionally, the very large sample size of 781,557 effectively eliminates any uncertainty about the results due to random chance.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2015/02/password-numbers/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-24T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2015/02/password-numbers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The primary purpose of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password">password</a> is to serve as an unique verification identifier for a given user. Ideally, the password for a given website or service should be both random and unique; if the letters and/or numbers in the password follow any patterns, then they might be easier to guess by an intruder. For example, someone may put their birth year such as &ldquo;1987&rdquo; or &ldquo;1988&rdquo; in their password, which makes the passwords easier to remember, but consequently easier to break.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, security researcher Mark Burnett released <a href="https://xato.net/passwords/ten-million-passwords/#.VNojhPnF98E">a list of 10 million passwords</a> compiled <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/10millionpasswords/comments/2w3ali/dataset_origin/conap8l">from various sources</a> over the years. Reddit user jalgroy <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2vsg7h/frequency_of_years_in_passwords_oc/">posted a histogram</a> of the years used in these passwords, which I&rsquo;ve verified using my own scripts:</p>

<p><img src="/img/password-numbers/year_distribution.png"></p>

<p>There is a clear maximum at 1987 which implies a current age of about 28. This makes sense, as internet users in their 20&rsquo;s are generally considered to be very attuned to internet usage. The spike at 2000 is likely not because it&rsquo;s a birth year, but because 2000 is a kewl number.</p>

<p>There are actually many similar patterns for numbers in passwords, which involve surprising yet intuitive logic.</p>

<h1>Digit Behavior</h1>

<p>The distribution of the number of digits in passwords varies significantly.</p>

<p><img src="/img/password-numbers/digit_distribution.png"></p>

<p>42% of passwords have zero numerical digits, which implies that 58% of passwords have atleast one digit. However, the local maxima in number of digits in a password all occur at <em>even</em> numbers of digits, which may imply that humans have an easier time of remembering even amounts of numbers.</p>

<p>If you look at a typical keyboard, you&rsquo;ll note that the default sequence of numbers is <strong>1234567890</strong>. If the user wants a number in their password that is easy to type, drawing from this sequence of numbers might be a good idea.</p>

<p><img src="/img/password-numbers/seq_digit_bar.png"></p>

<p>Note that the length of the sequence is uncorrelated with the number of occurrences of the sequence. Many more people use 123 in a password than just 12, even though it&rsquo;s longer. 123, as a triplet of numbers, may be easier to remember by the average person than a pair of numbers. However, that contradicts the logic above that even numbers may be easier to remember, which suggest that another factor may be involved.</p>

<p>Sequences of numbers are popular, but are some sequences of numbers more popular than others? Let&rsquo;s look at the order and composition of 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers in these 10 million passwords.</p>

<h1>More on Digit Patterns</h1>

<p><em>Note: all number patterns are distinct number patterns, e.g. 2-digit numbers analyzed are not subsets of 3-digit or larger numbers.</em></p>

<p>Take a look at the most used single-digit numbers:</p>

<p><img src="/img/password-numbers/one_digit_bar.png"></p>

<p>1 is by far the most-used single-digit number, which may be due to the fact that it is the left-most number on the keyboard and therefore an easy press for services that force the inclusion of a digit in the password. Relatedly, 9 and 0 are the least-used single-digit numbers. That&rsquo;s intuitive enough. But does that hold for more complex patterns?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the most-used 2-digit patterns, including numbers with 0 as a leading digit:</p>

<p><img src="/img/password-numbers/two_digit_bar.png"></p>

<p>12 and 11, a sequential pattern and a repeating pattern respectively, are by far the most-used 2-digit numbers. Many repeating patterns such as 22 and 99 are prominent. But why is 69 in third place? (besides the obvious non-family-friendly reason)</p>

<p>It may be helpful to look at a heat map of all possible 2-digit numbers to see if there are any observable patterns.</p>

<p><img src="/img/password-numbers/two_digit_heatmap.png"></p>

<p>There are a couple distinct patterns: numbers beginning with a 1 or 2 are used the most frequently, and both repeating and sequential digits are used the most frequently.</p>

<p>Almost all 2-digit numbers outside of those patterns are unused (the exception is 69, of course) The intersection of both of these patterns is at 11/12, which is the reason both have high usage.</p>

<p>Do 3-digit numbers follow similar patterns? Here&rsquo;s a list of the most-used 3-digit numbers in passwords:</p>

<p><img src="/img/password-numbers/three_digit_bar.png"></p>

<p>Yes and no. Here, there appear to be more instances of special numbers, such as 321 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond">007</a> which deviate from the patterns above. Of note, 3-digit numbers ending in 00 appears as a new pattern.</p>

<p>This can be confirmed by looking at a faceted heat map for each possible combination.</p>

<p><img src="/img/password-numbers/three_digit_heatmap.png"></p>

<p>By far the most popular pattern for a 3-digit number is a repetition pattern, followed by a sequential pattern (the sequential pattern is always located one tile up and two tiles right from the repetition pattern). There are very few outliers which deviate from this schema aside from the ones mentioned previously. (420 is not as significant of an outlier for 3-digit numbers as 69 is for 2-digit numbers)</p>

<p>The patterns of numbers in passwords can offer some insight to human psychology. However, if possible, I recommend you avoid using such patterns in your passwords since it introduces a vulnerability. It&rsquo;s a good idea to use a password manager instead, such as <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> or <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>, which offer advantages including the generation of both truly random and unique passwords.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[An Introduction on How to Make Beautiful Charts With R and ggplot2]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2015/02/ggplot-tutorial/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-12T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2015/02/ggplot-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Readers of my previous blog posts have frequently asked me &ldquo;how do you make those charts?&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/buzzfeed-listicle-scatterplot.png"></p>

<p>These charts were made using <a href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/">ggplot2</a>, an add-on package for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/index.html">R programming language</a>, along with lots of iterative improvement over the months. R notably has chart-making capabilities built into the language by default, but it is not easy to use and often produces <em>very</em> simplistic charts. Enter ggplot2, which allows users to create full-featured and robust charts with only a few lines of code.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/geom_histogram-4.png"></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen charts elsewhere on the internet similar to this one. While it implements the &ldquo;<a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html">Grammar of Graphics</a>&rdquo; (which is where the &ldquo;gg&rdquo; in &ldquo;ggplot2&rdquo; comes from), it does look generic and cluttered.</p>

<p>Adding a touch of color and design can help make more compelling visualizations, and it&rsquo;s pretty easy to do thanks to ggplot2&rsquo;s syntax and chaining capabilities.</p>

<h1>Quick Design Notes</h1>

<p>Charts with a completely-gray background have become rather popular lately, mostly in part to the charts produced by <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, which was the inspiration behind my design. An important functional aspect of a gray background is that it makes the chart area distinct from the article body.</p>

<p>The charts I make are typically 1200px by 900px. On my blog, the width of the article text container is less than 1200px, so the browser shrinks the chart to make it fit. The chart still appears at a high resolution on HiDPI/Retina screens, and since the charts are simple, shrinking will not cause significant graphical distortion on normal-resolution screens. 1200x900px also keeps the file size low, which is important when putting 10 or more charts in a post.</p>

<p>An important tip when making charts in ggplot2: render the chart on OS X, if possible. OS X has antialiasing for text and curves in charts, while Windows/Linux does not, and it can significantly improve the quality of the chart.</p>

<h1>Making a ggplot2 Histogram</h1>

<p>The first chart we&rsquo;ll be making is a histogram. This is a good example of a chart that&rsquo;s easy to make in R/ggplot2, but hard to make Excel.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll be using <code>ggplot2</code>, plus three additional R packages: <code>RColorBrewer</code>, which allows for the procedural generation of colors from a palette for the chart, <code>scales</code>, which allows for the axes to express numbers with commas/percents, and <code>grid</code>, which allows for manipulation of the chart margins and layout. We can install and load these packages at the beginning of the R file:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages(c("ggplot2","RColorBrewer","scales"))
library(ggplot2); library(scales); library(grid); library(RColorBrewer)
</code></pre>

<p>The dataset we&rsquo;ll use is my <a href="http://minimaxir.com/csv/buzzfeed_linkbait_headlines.csv">list of 15,101 BuzzFeed listicles</a> that I used <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2015/01/linkbait/">in my previous blog post</a>, including both the listicle size and number of Facebook shares the listicle received, which have been prefiltered to listicle sizes of 50 or less, and have received atleast 1 Facebook share. Download the file, and set the working directory of R to the containing folder. We load the dataset into R by reading the CSV:</p>

<pre><code>df &lt;- read.csv("buzzfeed_linkbait_headlines.csv", header=T)
</code></pre>

<p>We can make a basic histogram in two lines of code.</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(df, aes(listicle_size)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
</code></pre>

<p>The first line instantiates the charts and defines the variables used for plotting. We declare the use of the data frame <code>df</code>, and the <code>listicle_size</code> vector from that data frame as the plotting aesthetic. The second line tells ggplot to make a histogram out of the given data with <code>geom_histogram</code>, and we specify a binwidth of 1 so that each column represents one discrete value of listicle. Running that code will cause a plot to pop up.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/tutorial_1.png"></p>

<p>Not a bad start. In order to save the created plot, we use the <code>ggsave</code> command, which saves the last-generated plot to an image in your working directory. The first parameter, the filename, determines the filetype.</p>

<pre><code>ggsave("tutorial_1.png", dpi=300, width=4, height=3)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can add a theme to make it look classy.</p>

<p>A ggplot2 theme is a function that overrides the graphical parameters of the default theme. Here&rsquo;s the long code block for my FiveThirtyEight-inspired theme, with code comments for each code subblock:</p>

<pre><code>fte_theme &lt;- function() {

  # Generate the colors for the chart procedurally with RColorBrewer
  palette &lt;- brewer.pal("Greys", n=9)
  color.background = palette[2]
  color.grid.major = palette[3]
  color.axis.text = palette[6]
  color.axis.title = palette[7]
  color.title = palette[9]

  # Begin construction of chart
  theme_bw(base_size=9) +

  # Set the entire chart region to a light gray color
  theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill=color.background, color=color.background)) +
  theme(plot.background=element_rect(fill=color.background, color=color.background)) +
  theme(panel.border=element_rect(color=color.background)) +

  # Format the grid
  theme(panel.grid.major=element_line(color=color.grid.major,size=.25)) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks=element_blank()) +

  # Format the legend, but hide by default
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill=color.background)) +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size=7,color=color.axis.title)) +

  # Set title and axis labels, and format these and tick marks
  theme(plot.title=element_text(color=color.title, size=10, vjust=1.25)) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=7,color=color.axis.text)) +
  theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=7,color=color.axis.text)) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=8,color=color.axis.title, vjust=0)) +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(size=8,color=color.axis.title, vjust=1.25)) +

  # Plot margins
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0.35, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35), "cm"))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Adding the completed theme to the chart is just one line of code:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(df, aes(listicle_size)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  fte_theme()
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/tutorial_2.png"></p>

<p>A little more classy. Now that the core design of the chart is present, we can make polish the chart to make it more beautiful.</p>

<p>Of course, all charts need properly labled axes and a title. We can add that with the <code>labs</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(df, aes(listicle_size)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  fte_theme() +
  labs(title="Distribution of Listicle Sizes for BuzzFeed Listicles", x="# of Entries in Listicle", y="# of Listicles")
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/tutorial_3.png"></p>

<p>Now we can add a few finishing touches. For the x-axis, we can set the breaks to 5 instead of 10 using <code>scale_x_continuous</code> since we have the room. For the y-axis, since we have an axis value with 4 digits, we can set the formatting to use a comma with <code>scale_y_continuous</code>. Lastly, we can add a line at y = 0 using <code>geom_line</code> to further seperate the data. Lastly, in <code>geom_histogram</code>, we can change the fill of the bars to a red color for more thematic branding, and also reduce the opacity to make the grid lines visible behind the chart.</p>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(df, aes(listicle_size)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="#c0392b", alpha=0.75) +
  fte_theme() +
  labs(title="Distribution of Listicle Sizes for BuzzFeed Listicles", x="# of Entries in Listicle", y="# of Listicles") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,50, by=5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, size=0.4, color="black")
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/tutorial_4.png"></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty professional and is a good stopping point. Normally, I would change the text fonts as well, but that&rsquo;s a subject for another post.</p>

<h1>Making a ggplot2 Scatterplot</h1>

<p>Scatterplots are also efficient to do in ggplot2, which especially useful as making a plot containing 15,101 points might cause spreadsheets to freeze.</p>

<p>Creating a scatterplot of the relationship between listicle size and the number of Facebook shares the listicle receives is essentially the same procedure as creating a histogram, except that the x-axis and y-axis aesthetic vectors must be declared explicitly.</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(df, aes(x=listicle_size, y=num_fb_shares)) +
  geom_point()
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/tutorial_5.png"></p>

<p>Because there are a few listicles with <em>over 1 million</em> Facebook shares (welcome to 2015), the entire plot is skewed. As a result, we need to compress the plot by scaling the y-axis logarithmically using <code>scale_y_log10</code>. Additionally, there will be a large amount of overlap between points due to the large sample size, so we need to greatly reduce the opacity of the points. (I set to 5% for this chart, but the best value can be determined through trial and error)</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(df, aes(x=listicle_size, y=num_fb_shares)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.05) +
  scale_y_log10(labels=comma)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/tutorial_6.png"></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot more intuitive, and it makes it clear that there is indeed a positive relationship between listicle size and the number of Facebook shares.</p>

<p>Now we can apply the theme and labels:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(df, aes(x=listicle_size, y=num_fb_shares)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.05) +
  scale_y_log10(labels=comma) +
  fte_theme() +
  labs(x="# of Entries in Listicle", y="# of Facebook Shares", title="FB Shares vs. Listicle Size for BuzzFeed Listicles")
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/tutorial_7.png"></p>

<p>And then the final touches. We can include the same horizontal line, x-axis behavior, and point color as with the last plot. However, for the y-axis, we have room to include each power of 10 between 1 and 1,000,000 as breaks, which we can do through a cute R syntax trick: <code>10^(0:6)</code>. While the chart shows a positive relationship between the variables, the shape is ambiguous and it may be helpful to add a trend line. We use <code>geom_smooth</code> to add a trendline representing a <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/mgcv/gam">generalized additive model</a> with a 95% confidence interval.</p>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(df, aes(x=listicle_size, y=num_fb_shares)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.05, color="#c0392b") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,50, by=5)) +
  scale_y_log10(labels=comma, breaks=10^(0:6)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=1, size=0.4, color="black") +
  geom_smooth(alpha=0.25, color="black", fill="black") +
  fte_theme() +
  labs(x="# of Entries in Listicle", y="# of Facebook Shares", title="FB Shares vs. Listicle Size for BuzzFeed Listicles")
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/ggplot-tutorial/tutorial_8.png"></p>

<p>Now that is pretty insightful.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this small overview of how ggplot2 gives you an small idea of what it can do. This is just the tip of the iceberg. However, making cooler charts such as categorical bar charts, charts with multiple factor variables, and charts with multiple facets require smart data preprocessing, which is a topic for another blog post.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2015/01/linkbait/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-15T08:30:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2015/01/linkbait</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a> is one of the most significant sources of journalistic content on the entire internet. Of course, that depends on your definition of &ldquo;journalistic&rdquo;: BuzzFeed is one of the first organizations to leverage both social media and the power of language as an editorial business model.</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed_fb.png"></p>

<p>BuzzFeed has popularized the use of the &ldquo;listicle&rdquo; as <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/group-projects-should-be-wiped-off-the-face-o">seen above</a>: a bulleted list of text blurbs and/or photos that fits the length and depth of a normal blog article. Additionally, BuzzFeed was one of the first news sources to use non-neutral headlines that deliberately invoke a reaction in the reader which then subsequently tempts them to click on the article in an attempt to promote virality. These &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://mashable.com/2013/07/12/linkbait-content-marketing/">linkbait</a>&rdquo; techniques have been responsible for BuzzFeed receiving <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html">$50 million in venture capital</a>, and has spawned entire startups and job positions designed solely to emulate BuzzFeed&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>I decided to determine which phrases in BuzzFeed headlines are the most successful in order to see if it&rsquo;s possible to reverse-engineer BuzzFeed&rsquo;s business model. Therefore, I scraped BuzzFeed&rsquo;s website (<a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/buzzscrape/">after initial frustration</a>) and obtained 60,378 distinct articles and the corresponding number of Facebook Shares for each article. From there, I decomposed each headline into its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">component n-grams</a>, allowing me to perform quantitative analysis for each possible permutation of words in the article titles. You probably don&rsquo;t know that the 3 most interesting things I found will blow your mind.</p>

<h1>The Rise of the Listicle</h1>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed_listicle.png"></p>

<p>Listicles almost always begin with a numeral as the first or second word. Out of the 60,378 articles I obtained, 26% of them (15,656 articles) are listicles. BuzzFeed clearly believes they are successful, as the proportion of listicles to normal articles has increased over the years.</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-listicle-proportions.png"></p>

<p>Listicles can be of any size. The distibution of listicle sizes is centered at the median of 19 entries.</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-listicle-histogram.png"></p>

<p>Surprisingly, there is a positive correlation between listicle size and the number of Facebook shares it receives: A 30-size listicle receives many-multiples of shares more than 10-size listicles. (note the logarithmic scale for FB Shares)</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-listicle-scatterplot.png"></p>

<p>BuzzFeed has many different types of listicles to appeal to a wide crowd, including <em>[X] reasons</em>, <em>[X] books</em>, <em>[X] movies</em>, etc, where <em>[X]</em> is any 1 or 2-digit numeral. However, BuzzFeed&rsquo;s go-to listicle phrase has changed over the years. Here are the most-used listicle phrases for each month since 2012:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px; height: 300px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9SWJsmepYdb6YjWCFzM0gsuuDC5PBeFJZkTmJ568fs/pubhtml?gid=1424838564&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>


<p>In 2012 and 2013, BuzzFeed&rsquo;s listicles began with <em>the [X]</em>; in 2014, BuzzFeed&rsquo;s most-used listicles began with <em>[X] things</em>. The &ldquo;the&rdquo; is technically redundant; perhaps BuzzFeed decided to make the listicle schema cleaner and <em>less</em> formal. It may be possible that <em>[X] things</em> performs better on average than <em>the [X]</em>.</p>

<p>Which types of listicles are the most successful on Facebook? Which types of listicles receive the most amount of Facebook shares?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart of of the Top 30 types of listicles by the number of Facebook shares those articles have received on average (with a minimum of 50 articles of that listicle type):</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-shares-listicles.png"></p>

<p>A few notes on the chart: the gray bars on each average bar represent a <strong>95% confidence interval</strong> for the true value of each average, where the confidence interval is obtained through 10,000 iterations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29">bootstrap resampling</a>. The dashed vertical line represents the <strong>population average</strong> of all distinct BuzzFeed articles, at 6,657 Facebook shares, and helps visualize the relative impact of having these words in the title compared to a normal BuzzFeed article.</p>

<p>The most-posted listicle types mentioned above are <em>not</em> the types of listicles are most shared, however <em>[X] things</em> does indeed perform slightly better than <em>the [X]</em> on average. Emotional words, such as <em>insanely</em>, <em>awesome</em>, and <em>probably</em>, which you would never see in a more serious journalistic publication, are some of the key drivers of shares.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look into these keywords more to see if there are any other trends.</p>

<h1>Key Keywords</h1>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed_1gram.jpg"></p>

<p>Specific keywords may be more informative. Here&rsquo;s the most popular keywords over time, ignoring common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop words</a> and listicle words:</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px; height: 300px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9SWJsmepYdb6YjWCFzM0gsuuDC5PBeFJZkTmJ568fs/pubhtml?gid=1106341985&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>


<p>Like most journalistic news sources, BuzzFeed tends to write more frequently toward then-current events. 2012 for example had many articles about the 2012 election, while April 2013 consisted of many articles about the Boston Marathon bombings.</p>

<p>Which keywords encouraged the most Facebook shares on average?</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-shares-1gram.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a more uncertainty in the accuracy of the average on keywords, especially with the #1 word, <em>career</em>. There&rsquo;s a strong focus on nostalgia, with <em>toys</em>, <em>childhood</em>, and <em>80s</em>. Certain brands (<em>potter</em> and <em>disney</em>) fit the nostalgia too.</p>

<p>High words with a relatively small confidence interval and <em>which</em> and <em>character</em>. These are likely caused by <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/quizzes">BuzzFeed&rsquo;s quizzes</a>, which have been incredibly popular. Analyzing full phrases is necessary to get a bigger picture.</p>

<h1>3-Word Phrases</h1>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed_3gram.png"></p>

<p>After careful analysis, I found that 3-word phrases (trigrams) provided more helpful information than phrases of other lengths. Over time, there are similarities with the popular phrases; they both relate to then-current event and occasionally contain listicles.</p>

<iframe style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px; height: 300px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U9SWJsmepYdb6YjWCFzM0gsuuDC5PBeFJZkTmJ568fs/pubhtml?gid=249061324&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>


<p>The average shares of articles based on phrases in their titles, however, tell the full story.</p>

<p><img src="/img/linkbait/buzzfeed-shares-3gram-v2.png"></p>

<p>Now we can clearly see some the infamous phrases traditionally associated with clickbait.</p>

<p>Indeed, <em>character are you</em>, a frequent phrase in quizzes, is what leads to the most virality. (It&rsquo;s worth nothing that these perform 3-4 times better than the best listicles on average). Likewise, you may notice a few phrases are redundant and subset of a bigger phrase (e.g. <em>things you probably</em>, <em>you probably don&rsquo;t</em>, <em>probably don&rsquo;t know</em>), but since the averages FB shares aren&rsquo;t identical, it&rsquo;s not a perfect subset, and therefore the average is relevant. There&rsquo;s also a frequent appeal to <em>you</em>, the reader, with <em>you/your/you&rsquo;re</em> appearing in about half of the top phrases.</p>

<p>Does clickbait work? Of course it does. Granted, there has been a lot of disenchantment with the rise of clickbait; that&rsquo;s why the parody Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/SavedYouAClick">@SavedYouAClick</a> was created and hit 182K followers in months. It&rsquo;s also the reason why <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/08/news-feed-fyi-click-baiting/">Facebook will now be punishing clickbait</a> and making them less public in a user&rsquo;s news feed, which will definitely hurt BuzzFeed. That&rsquo;s likely one of the reasons why they are pivoting to quizzes and video content instead.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect clickbait to disappear anytime soon; it&rsquo;s easy and provides a good return-on-investment, both of which are important to scrappy websites trying to market on social media. Or things could come full-circle and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/photos-that-prove-game-of-thrones-happened-in-real-life">BuzzFeed could publish clickbait about making the best clickbait</a>.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-01T09:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2015/01/tree-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone enjoys taking photos of their Christmas trees, usually at their own home of their relatives. <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> allows users to quickly upload any photo and share it socially to the world. On Christmas Eve, privacy author Tommy Collison <a href="http://www.tommycollison.com/blog/2014/12/24/christmas-geotagging">published a warning about this behavior</a>, noting that if a user tags a photo with #tree to tag their Christmas tree, for example, <em>anyone</em> will be able to see it, and if the user attached their location to the photo, anyone could theoretically find where they live.</p>

<p>How practical is this concern? Instagram <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">offers an API</a> of all recent photos for a given #tag so developers can download pictures and their corresponding metadata, such as geolocation, in bulk. (Up to <em>165,000</em> Instagram images can be processed per hour!)</p>

<p>I downloaded <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of #tree images and found 25,432 images which were taken on Christmas, have a #tree, and, most importantly, contain location data where the photo was taken. From that, I created an <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1J3RQB6MuFbZvA_WcCVHlKAzDBUppxFBQ3LA054RL">interactive map</a> showing the location of all these images worldwide using <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en">Google Fusion Tables</a>. You can click-and-drag to move the map all over the world, and you can click on a marker on the map to see the Instagram image taken at that location! (note that if you&rsquo;re on a mobile device, the embedded map may work better on a desktop browser)</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col8+from+1J3RQB6MuFbZvA_WcCVHlKAzDBUppxFBQ3LA054RL&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=50.13422309020635&amp;lng=-46.22345629918755&amp;t=1&amp;z=3&amp;l=col8&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=3&amp;hml=TWO_COL_LAT_LNG"></iframe>


<p>I found a few interesting things while playing with this map.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-tree"></i> Christmas Trees in the USA</h1>

<p>A downside of the interactive map is that quantifying the relative number of photos between dense areas (e.g. cities) can be misleading as the opaque markers overlap. Here is a static map of all of the Instagram photos in the United States, with each translucent point representing an image:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/instagram_treemap_state.png"></p>

<p>The number of photos is densest near the large cities, which is what you would expect.</p>

<p>A way to calculate the relative proportion of the number of #tree photos between states is to use a type of chart known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">treemap</a> (pun <em>very</em> much intended).</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/treemap-state.png"></p>

<p>In this treemap, the relative area of each block corresponds to the number of photos taken in the state; therefore, the combination of all the blocks represents 100% of the #tree photos taken in the USA. If two blocks are the same size (e.g. New York and Florida), then they have the same number of #tree photos.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed from these two charts, these data represented by these two charts is approximately the same as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population">population density in the United States</a>. Although this touches on the <a href="http://xkcd.com/1138/">infamous statistical problem</a> of heat maps resembling population maps, in this case, it&rsquo;s what would be expected.</p>

<p>Looking at all the #tree photos in the world may tell a different story.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Christmas Trees in the World</h1>

<p>Christmas is a holiday for only one religion with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_by_country">low presence in Asia and northern Africa</a>, so it would be expected that the locations of Christmas trees worldwide do <em>not</em> correlate with population, which makes the analysis more interesting.</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/instagram_world_map.png"></p>

<p>The prevalence of Christmas trees is most prominent in the United States and Europe, with relatively few in Asia, where the majority of the world&rsquo;s population is located. Italy has Christmas trees <em>uniformly</em> throughout the entire country, which is an interesting behavior.</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/treemap-world.png"></p>

<p>The treemap confirms that Asian and African countries like China, India, and Nigeria do not have as many Christmas trees than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">what their large populations would suggest</a>. Italy, however has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Italy">population of 60 million</a> (the same as the United Kingdom) which is about 1/5th of the population of United States; the fact that Italy has more than half of the number of Christmas Trees than the United States is very unusual and should be questioned.</p>

<p>Italy <em>may</em> have a high number of Christmas trees since Vatican City is the seat of the papacy, but perhaps data <em>itself</em> should be questioned too.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> &ldquo;Christmas Trees&rdquo; in the World</h1>

<p>If you check the photos in Italy, you many notice that many of them have a photo caption similar to this one:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/christmas_tagsforlikes.png"></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s obviously no Christmas tree in that photo. But there are a <em>lot</em> of tags.</p>

<p>Many Instagram photos use a service called <a href="http://www.tagsforlikes.com/">TagsForLikes</a>, which complies a list of popular hashtags that other users are able to see. Users can then then copy/paste them into the photo caption to spam hashtags increase the photo exposure, which, as I&rsquo;ve shown <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/03/hashtag-tag/">in a previous blog post</a>, does in fact increase the number of Likes the photo receives from other users.</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/tags4likes.png"></p>

<p>Notice a resemblance between this list and the photo caption?</p>

<p>Fortunately, all the TagsForLikes hashtag lists contain #TagsForLikes as a branding trick, which makes such photos extremely easy to detect. Here&rsquo;s what the world map looks like if all the potentially spam photos were colored red:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/instagram_world_spamnonspam.png"></p>

<p>Italy looks a <em>lot</em> different now! There is red in other counties, but it&rsquo;s not easily visible at a glance.</p>

<p>The treemap of photos, when seperated between spam and non-spam photos, tells the full story:</p>

<p><img src="/img/tree-time/treemap-spam-nonspam.png"></p>

<p>About 20% of all the #tree photos are spam photos, and about half of those were taken by people in Italy. As a result, Italy has <em>more spam #tree photos than nonspam #tree photos!</em> This is an interesting cultural phenomenon that I have no guesses as to why it occurs. All other countries have significantly smaller numbers of spam photos relatively non-spam photos.</p>

<p>For non-spam photos, the number of #tree photos in Italy now matches the number of non-spam photos in the UK, which correlates with their populations, making the removal of spam photos a sane move.</p>

<p>Is it possible to track people in their homes via Instagram tags? Definitely. If you do care privacy and your Instagram account is not set to Private, I recommend not geotagging your photos. If you&rsquo;re interested in looking at such photos,  ensure that the the tag is relevant for the given photo.</p>
