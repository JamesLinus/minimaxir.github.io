    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/10/hn-comments-about-comments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last February, I <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/hacking-hacker-news/">published an article</a> about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, a tech-oriented link aggregator run by startup accelerator <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>. In that post, I analyzed all submissions to date, and noted that the site has a strong and active userbase.</p>

<p>In recent months, however, Hacker News has undergone criticism. A blog post by Danilo Campos titled &ldquo;<a href="http://danilocampos.com/2014/09/y-combinator-and-the-negative-externalities-of-hacker-news/">Y Combinator and the negative externalities of Hacker News</a>&rdquo;, notes that although Hacker News is a critical resource for young male techies based in Silicon Valley (<em>Disclosure: I am a young male techie based in Silicon Valley</em>), this has the consequence of excluding female hackers. Campos has even created a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23hnwatch&amp;src=typd">#HNwatch</a> hashtag to catalog sexist and insensitive comments made by Hacker News users. As a long-time <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir">user on Hacker News</a>, I unfortunately <a href="https://twitter.com/minimaxir/status/468080907925340160">agree with this assessment</a> at times.</p>

<p>In fairness, such comments are in the minority on Hacker News. Or are they?</p>

<p>In order to better assess the quality, popularity, and negativity of Hacker News comments over the years, I&rsquo;ve downloaded 5,592,362 comments from Hacker News, the maximum number of comments possible, from its beginnings in 2006 to October 2014. Hopefully, these comments will answer whether Hacker News is experiencing a rise in quality, or if the complaints levied against HN are valid.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwonVX_KlDYhuhPnAAnVpdVRgu4LxldP74-c_kvOd5k/edit?usp=sharing">glance at Hacker News&rsquo;s best comments</a>, determined by the number of upvotes it receives from the Hacker News community, for each month since 2006:</p>

<div><iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwonVX_KlDYhuhPnAAnVpdVRgu4LxldP74-c_kvOd5k/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></div>


<p>There are interesting trends in this sample data set. The types of comments that became popular in 2006-2008 Hacker News were one-line quips, akin to those you would see in the comments on modern Reddit (which is a topic for another blog post). Highly-voted comments often come from the same people, especially those from Paul Graham (pg), Founder and then-President of Y Combinator.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/early_reddit.png"></p>

<p>This may indicate a bias or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">halo effect</a> where the commenter is more impactful than the comment itself. Additionally, some comments received many upvotes due to context: the top comment in December 2010 was simply &ldquo;sad.&rdquo; in a thread about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2013248">Yahoo Shutting Down Delicious</a>, but the comment was made by Joshua Schachter (joshu), the creator of Delicious.</p>

<p>Compare those older comments to those made between 2012-2014. Those comments are very long, insightful, and made by many different people. (including a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4689643">comment by Danilo Campos himself</a> in October 2012)</p>

<p>However, these are the good comments. The bad comments are <em>especially</em> bad.</p>

<p>Here are a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfbSDYVBXiHZCuMdHXgprhmeCVc4XDtOGizF9CSGyUo/edit?usp=sharing">set of Hacker News&rsquo;s worst comments</a> from each month where the comment has received a score of -3 or -4, the lowest score before the comment is automatically killed. (<em>Warning: comments may cause you to lose faith in humanity and/or be unintentionally hilarious</em>)</p>

<div><iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfbSDYVBXiHZCuMdHXgprhmeCVc4XDtOGizF9CSGyUo/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></div>


<p>The types of bad comments haven&rsquo;t changed over the years. Hostile comments are immediately downvoted. It&rsquo;s worth noting that on Hacker News, you can be downvoted for being factually wrong.</p>

<p>Some users are more active commenters than others. Out of Hacker News&rsquo;s 176,692 users who have made atleast 1 comment, only 48% of those commenters end up leaving two more comments, and only 6% of HN users end up leaving 100 or more comments total.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/n-comments.png"></p>

<p>However, as users comment more on Hacker News and learn the intricacies of HN&rsquo;s culture, they become more skilled at creating quality comments which receive higher scores, which serve as an indicator of quality. As Hacker News users comment more and more, the average expected comment score for each successive post increases.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/n-comments-practice.png"></p>

<p><em>(The faded area for all charts in this article represents a 95% confidence interval for the average at a given point; all of the confidence intervals are very narrow due to the sheer quantity of data present. Whoo, big data!)</em></p>

<p>What are the trends behind the Hacker News comments? First, we must see how Hacker News comments has changed over time.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i></span> Hacking Through The Years</h1>

<p>As one would expect, the number of new comments posted on Hacker News each month has been gradually increasing proportional to its popularity, although the number of new comments per month has decreased starting in 2014, which indicates a slowing growth rate.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/monthly_total_comments.png"></p>

<p>However, has Hacker News retained quality with its increasing notoriety? One way to check is to analyze the average amount of points of the comments. Hacker News comments start out at 1 point, and other users can upvote and downvote comments.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/monthly_average_points.png"></p>

<p>The minimum average points score of any given comment was about 2 points, meaning that all comments received atleast 1 upvote on average. This trend has been increasing until 2011 when it peaked at about 4.5 points. Since then, the average has trended downward, with a particularly large drop starting at 2014.</p>

<p>Therefore, starting in 2014, both quantity <em>and</em> quality are on a downward trend.</p>

<p>Another way to gauge quality is to look at the average comment length. Are comments trending toward short quips, or are longform comments more popular?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/monthly_average_words.png"></p>

<p>The length of the average comment has increased by about 10% over the years, which shows a slight increase in the overall thoughtfulness of HN comments.</p>

<p>Has the average sentiment on Hacker News changed over the years? To gauge the relative sentiment of Hacker News comments, I compared each word of the comment against a lexicon of positive/negative words, and counted the number of review words in the lexicon. In this case, I used the <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html">lexicons compiled by UIC professor Bing Liu</a>. This is the same method used in my <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/one-star-five-stars/">previous analysis of Yelp reviews</a>, where the technique was very effective. However, unlike Yelp, comments on Hacker News tend to make use of sarcasm, so this method may be less effective. (there isn&rsquo;t any easy method for detecting sarcasm, because who in the entire world would want an easy method for detecting sarcasm?)</p>

<p>From that, we can calculate average positivity and average negativity for a given comment by dividing the number of positive/negative words respectively by the approximate number of words in the comment. Both metrics have converged slightly over the years.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/monthly_average_positive_negative.png"></p>

<p>In September 2014, the average positivity of a comment is <em>3.2%</em>, while the average negativity of a comment is <em>2.3%</em> (leading to a 0.9% net positive sentiment).</p>

<p>The nature of the comments Hacker News has definitely changed since the site&rsquo;s humble beginnings in 2006, but it&rsquo;s hard to determine if it&rsquo;s for the <em>better</em>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look more into the nature of the upvote system.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></span> Free Points</h1>

<p>As mentioned, the number of points on a new Hacker News comment starts at 1 point. Anyone can give an upvote, which increases the points value by one. However, long-time HN users can downvote posts, decreasing the score by 1. Downvoting has another effect; comments with 0 or fewer points turn an aesthetically-displeasing gray, in an effort to both hide them from the public eye and encourage corrective upvotes if necessary from users with OCD. In all other cases, the points score of a comment is hidden from other users in order to help prevent bandwagoning and the upvoting of comments just because they have lots of upvotes.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/distribution_comment_points.png"></p>

<p>Over 50% of all comments simply have 1 or 2 points, with the proportion decreasing by a third for each successive point value. What&rsquo;s surprising is how few comments have 0 or fewer points: this shows that HN users do not like downvoting.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that comment length could be used a proxy for comment quality. Is there a relationship between the number of points a comment receives and the length of a comment?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/distribution_comment_points_words.png"></p>

<p>Surprisingly, yes! The effect of comment length on the number of points a comment received is likely not solely causal, but the correlation between the two values is helpful. (it is statistically unlikely to receive a lot of upvotes if your comment is short. The inverse is also true; a short comment is much more likely get downvoted.)</p>

<p>Is there a similar correlation between sentiment and the number of points a comment receives?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/distribution_comment_points_sentiment.png"></p>

<p>Nope. Both positivity and negativity are relatively static regardless of point values, although it&rsquo;s worth noting that comments with 0 or fewer points (downvoted comments) have a disproportionately high negativity.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-ban"></i></span> Tone and Tolerance on Hacker News</h1>

<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference between the language used in a Hacker News comment on a typical submission, and the language used in Hacker News submissions about women and diversity.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/hn_2_gram_small.jpg"></p>

<p>This word cloud consists of bigrams made from 109k comments from HN submissions in September 2014, and from 21k comments in threads whose submission title contains &ldquo;women&rdquo;, &ldquo;female,&rdquo; or &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; The language in the former is more neutral and about the content of the article (apparently Hacker News users <em>really</em> like to talk about Open Source software), while the submissions about gender and diversity trend to talk about tangent topics.</p>

<p>How does the tone differ between the two groups of articles? Here&rsquo;s the distribution of the average number of positive words in comments per submission in September 2014:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/density_september_2014_hn.png"></p>

<p>The average amount of positive words in a comment made in September 2014 is 2.16 words, and the average amount of negative words is 1.46, with both of those values being close to the respective statistical modes.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare that to the distribution of comments made on all submissions about women and diversity.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-comments/density_women.png"></p>

<p>The average amount of positive words in a comment made in thread about gender and diversity is 2.48 words, a little higher than the average, and is also the most frequently occuring value. However, The average amount of positive words in a comment made in thread about gender and diversity is 2.10 words, a much higher increase. The average is to the right of the mode, indicating that the average is skewed-right by submissions with overly-negative comments. This may be why there is a greater perception of negativity for readers of comment threads about women and diversity.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hackernews.html">stated goals of Hacker News</a> is to avoid an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a>, where the quality of discourse drops and everyone leaves. It&rsquo;s clear that the quality of discourse has changed over the years: comments are longer, but not necessarily better. Positivity has decreased and negativity has increased. The difference between 2006 HN and 2014 HN is stark.</p>

<p>Hacker News isn&rsquo;t the perfect tech news aggregator. The issue of inclusion is real, and despite the fact that sexist comments are in the minority, they need to stop. In 2014, both quantity <em>and</em> quality are decreasing. But since that Y Combinator has <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/diversity-and-startups">committed to ending sexism in tech</a> and <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/meet-the-people-taking-over-hacker-news">appointed new moderators</a> to control content quality, I&rsquo;m confident that things will improve in the future for Hacker News.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
<li><em>Data was retrieved from Hacker News using <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">the official API</a>. The data was then stored in a PostgreSQL database, mostly so I could take advantage of that database&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/tutorial-window.html">window functions</a> capability.</em></li>
<li><em>Charts, word clouds, and other miscellaneous data processing was done using R and ggplot2. Gathering the data from the API and extracting the bigrams for the word clouds was done using Python.</em></li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The Least Effective Method For Blocking Web Scraping of a Website]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/buzzscrape/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-26T10:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/buzzscrape</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who typically plays around with data from public website APIs, I figured it would be worthwhile to learn how to get data from websites the old-fashioned way: through force, via web scraping. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">Web scraping</a> is a technique where the user downloads the raw HTML of a webpage, and parses the inherent structure of the webpage to extract the necessary data.</p>

<p>In order to understand the mechanics behind web scraping, I used a tool from new Y Combinator startup <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>, which allows the user to click structured elements of any website and quickly create an API that can access all the collected data and convert it into an easy-to-access form. My first target was BuzzFeed, since their social interaction data might be useful in determining how it became so big so quickly, and maybe also determine just how effective those stupid listicles are.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i></span> Live Free and Scrape Hard</h1>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a pair of typical BuzzFeed articles:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_example.png"></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the corresponding output of <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/apis/1x3l57k0">my Kimono Labs BuzzFeed scraper</a> for those two articles:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>{
         &quot;title&quot;: {
          &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Stop Tweeting Instagram Links&quot;,
          &quot;href&quot;: &quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/stop-tweeting-instagram-links&quot;
        },
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I CANNOT REMAIN SILENT ON THIS ISSUE ANY LONGER.&quot;,
        &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Katie Notopoulos&quot;,
        &quot;num_responses&quot;: &quot;123&quot;
      },
      {
        &quot;title&quot;: {
          &quot;text&quot;: &quot;28 Things Your Gchat Availability Status Really Means&quot;,
          &quot;href&quot;: &quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/28-things-your-gchat-availability-status-really-means&quot;
        },
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Let’s chat.&quot;,
        &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Katie Heaney&quot;,
        &quot;num_responses&quot;: &quot;13&quot;
      }
}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This data format (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>) can be processed and manipulated by nearly any modern programming language.</p>

<p>Each BuzzFeed category page has about 22 articles, but the scraper can also access successive pages to retrieve more articles. This works by finding the URL of the next page by deriving the URL from the &ldquo;Older&rdquo; button if present on that page. Then the scraper can find the Older button on the page after that, and so forth, until all pages on BuzzFeed are scraped.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_page.png"></p>

<p>My BuzzFeed scraper, for some reason, only retrieved 10 pages maximum. So I used my QA skills and traced the exact route the scraper took, navigating through all 10 pages by clicking the Older button.</p>

<p>What was on Page #10 shocked me. OMG. I could not believe my eyes.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_disable.png"></p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-times-circle-o"></i></span> No Scrape For You</h1>

<p>The Older button is <em>disabled</em> on page 10? <strong>WHY?</strong></p>

<p>BuzzFeed is a website created in the 21st century that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html?_r=0">just raised $50 million</a>. This is not a peculiar technical limitation due to bad coding or bad infrastructure; this is a deliberate functional aspect of the product.</p>

<p>It is my personal mantra that if a startup has a particularly unintuitive UI/UX behavior, it&rsquo;s a form of &ldquo;growth hacking&rdquo; that my feeble brain cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>Could the reason that BuzzFeed disables access to pages past 10 is that they want to prevent archive browsing, thereby putting more of an emphasis on more recent and more potentially-viral articles? That wouldn&rsquo;t make sense; if a person is so hooked on BuzzFeed articles that they are at Page 10, why stop them? It&rsquo;s still free page views and ad revenue.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s likely that BuzzFeed has statistics on how many users actually visit article pages up to Page 10. Perhaps their data analysts noted &ldquo;hey, only 0.0027% of our visitors actually read up to Page 10, anyone who actually reads that far is three standard deviations away from normal, therefore they must be a web scraper!&rdquo; and recommend punitive action accordingly.</p>

<p>I noted earlier that it definitely was not a technical limitation that kept pages greater than 10 from being accessed. If you look at the URLs of the BuzzFeed screenshots above, you&rsquo;ll notice a &ldquo;<em>p=2</em>&rdquo; parameter for Page 2 or a &ldquo;<em>p=10</em>&rdquo; parameter for Page 10. What happens if you just change the 10 to a 11?</p>

<p>You go to Page 11. And you can go all the way to page <em>200</em> in some categories.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_200.png"></p>

<p>Incidentally, this is easier and more reliable to implement programmatically than searching for the Older button and extracting the URL.</p>

<p>So the disabling of the button will only stop stupid web scrapers. Yes, that makes my BuzzFeed web scraper a stupid web scraper, <em>but that&rsquo;s not the point!</em> It just makes the BuzzFeed&rsquo;s motive behind disabling the button at Page 10  even more baffling.</p>

<p>What did I do now that my quick-and-dirty BuzzFeed scraper couldn&rsquo;t parse a statistically significant amount of BuzzFeed articles? I did the only logical thing.</p>

<p>I spent a weekend learning how to use <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> in Python and parsed BuzzFeed the hard way, while changing the page number in the URL to pagenate through the pages. And I even was able to add new features to the scraper, such as simultaneously scraping the number of Facebook Shares a given BuzzFeed article generates.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/buzzscrape/buzzfeed_listicles.png"></p>

<p>Hey, there <em>is</em> a relationship between listicle size and social media engagement!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The Statistical Difference Between 1-Star and 5-Star Reviews on Yelp]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/one-star-five-stars/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-23T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/one-star-five-stars</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many business in the real world encourage their customers to &ldquo;Rate us on Yelp!&rdquo;. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>, the &ldquo;best way to find local businesses,&rdquo; relies on user reviews to help its viewers find the best places. Both positive and negative reviews are helpful in this mission: positive reviews on Yelp identify the best places, negative reviews identify places where people <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> go. Usually, both positive and negative reviews are not based on objective attributes of the business, but on the experience the writer has with the establishment.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp_review_pos.png"></p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp_review_neg.png"></p>

<p>I analyzed the language present in 1,125,458 Yelp Reviews using the dataset from the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge">Yelp Dataset Challenge</a> containing reviews of businesses in the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Madison, Waterloo and Edinburgh. Users can rate businesses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 stars. When comparing the most-frequent two-word phrases between 1-star and 5-star reviews, the difference is apparent.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/Yelp-2-Gram-Small.jpg"></p>

<p>The 5-star Yelp reviews contain many instances of &ldquo;Great&rdquo;, &ldquo;Good&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Happy&rdquo;. In contrast, the 1-star Yelp reviews use very little positive language, and instead discuss the amount of &ldquo;minutes,&rdquo; presumably after long and unfortunate waits at the establishment. (Las Vegas is one of the cities where the reviews were collected, which is why it appears prominently in both 1-star and 5-star reviews)</p>

<p>Looking at three-word phrases tells more of a story.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/Yelp-3-Gram-Small.jpg"></p>

<p>1-Star reviews frequently contain warnings for potential customers, which promises that the author will &ldquo;never go back&rdquo; and a strong impression that issues stem from conflicts with &ldquo;the front desk&rdquo;, such as those at hotels. 5-star reviews &ldquo;love this place&rdquo; and &ldquo;can&rsquo;t wait to&rdquo; go back.</p>

<p>Can this language be used to predict reviews?</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i></span> Regression of Language</h1>

<p>To determine the causal impact on positive and negative words on the # of stars given in a review, we can perform a simple linear regression of stars on the number of positive words in the review, the number of negative words in the review, and the number of words in the review itself (since the length of the review is related to the number of positive/negative words; the longer the review, the more words)</p>

<p>A quick-and-dirty way to determine the number of positive/negative words in a given Yelp review is to compare each word of the review against a lexicon of positive/negative words, and count the number of review words in the lexicon. In this case, I use the <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html">lexicons compiled by UIC professor Bing Liu</a>.</p>

<p>Running a regression of # stars in a Yelp review on # positive words, # negative words, and # words in review, returns these results:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>Coefficients:
               Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr(&gt;|t|)    
(Intercept)    3.692      1.670e-03  2210.0   &lt;2e-16 ***
pos_words      0.122      2.976e-04   411.3   &lt;2e-16 ***
neg_words     -0.154      4.887e-04  -315.9   &lt;2e-16 ***
review_words  -0.003      1.984e-05  -169.4   &lt;2e-16 ***

Residual standard error: 1.119 on 1125454 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.2589,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.2589 
F-statistic: 1.311e+05 on 3 and 1125454 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16</code></pre>
</div>


<p>The regression output explains these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a reviewer posted a blank review with no text in it, that review gave an average rating of 3.692.</li>
<li>For every positive word, the predicted average star rating given is increased by 0.122 on average (e.g. 8 positive words indicate a 1-star increase)</li>
<li>For every negative word, the predicted average star rating given is decreased by 0.15 on average (e.g. 6-7 negative words indicate a 1-star decrease)</li>
<li>The amount of words in the review has a lesser, negative effect. (A review that is 333 words indicates a 1-star decrease, but the average amount of words in a Yelp review is 130 words)</li>
<li>This model explains 25.98% of the variation in the number of stars given in a review. This sounds like a low percentage, but is impressive for such a simple model using unstructured real-world data.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these conclusions are <em>extremely</em> statistically significant due to the large sample size.</p>

<p>Additionally, you could rephrase the regression as a logistic classification problem, where reviews rated 1, 2, or 3 stars are classified as &ldquo;negative,&rdquo; and reviews with 4 or 5 stars are classified as &ldquo;positive.&rdquo; Then, run the regression to determine the likelihood of a given review being positive. Running this regression (not shown) results in a logistic model with up to <em>75% accuracy</em>, a noted improvement over the &ldquo;no information rate&rdquo; of 66%, which is the model accuracy if you just guessed that every review was positive. The logistic model also has similar conclusions for the predictor variables as the linear model.</p>

<p>It can be proven that language has a strong statistical effect on review ratings, but that&rsquo;s intuitive enough. How have review ratings changed?</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i></span> 1-Star and 5-Star Reviews, Visualized</h1>

<p>Since 2005, Yelp has had incredible growth in the number of new reviews.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp-review-time-series.png"></p>

<p>For that chart, it appears that each of the five rating brackets have grown at the same rate, but that isn&rsquo;t the case. Here&rsquo;s a chart of the rating brackets showing how the proportions of new reviews of each rating have changed over time.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp-review-time-proportion.png"></p>

<p>Early Yelp had mostly 4-star and 5-star reviews, as one might expect for an early Web 2.0 startup where the primary users who would be the only ones who would put in the effort to write a review would be those who had positive experiences. However, the behavior from 2010 onward is interesting: the relative proportions of both 1-star reviews <em>and</em> 5-star reviews increases over time.</p>

<p>As a result, the proportions of ratings in reviews from Yelp&rsquo;s beginning in 2005 and Yelp&rsquo;s present 2014 are incredibly different.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/Yelp-2005-2014.png"></p>

<p>More negativity, more positivity. Do they cancel out?</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-heart"></i></span> How Positive Are Yelp Reviews?</h1>

<p>We can calculate relative <strong>positivity</strong> between reviews by taking the number of positive reviews in a review and dividing it by the number of words in the review itself.</p>

<p>The average positivity among all reviews is <em>5.6%</em>. Over time, the positivity has been relatively flat.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp-review-time-series-positivity.png"></p>

<p>Flat, but still increasing, mostly likely due to the increasing proportion of 5-star reviews. But the number of 1-star reviews also increased: do the two offset each other?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp-review-positivity.png"></p>

<p>This histogram of positivity scores shows that 1-star reviews have lower positivity with rarely high positivity, and 5-star reviews rarely have low positivity and instead have very high positivity. The distribution for each star rating is close to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Normal distribution</a>, with each successive rating category peaking at increasing positivity values.</p>

<p>The relative proportion of each star rating reinforces this.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp-review-positivity-density.png"></p>

<p>Over half of the 0% positivity reviews are 1-star reviews, while over three-quarters of the reviews at the highest positivity levels are 5-star reviews. (note that the 2-star, 3-star, and 4-star ratings are not as significant at either extreme)</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-meh-o"></i></span> How Negative Are Yelp Reviews?</h1>

<p>When working with the negativity of reviews, calculated by taking the number of negative words and dividing them by the number of total words in the review, the chart looks much different.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp-review-time-series-negativity.png"></p>

<p>The average negativity among all reviews is <em>2.0%</em>. Since the average positivity is 5.6%, this implies that the net sentiment among all reviews is positive, despite the increase in 1-star reviews over time.</p>

<p>The histogram of negative reviews looks much different as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp-review-negativity.png"></p>

<p>Even 1-star reviews aren&rsquo;t completely negative all the time.</p>

<p>The chart is heavily skewed right, making it difficult to determine the proportions of each rating at first glance.</p>

<p>Henceforth here&rsquo;s another proportion chart.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/one-star-five-stars/yelp-review-negativity-density.png"></p>

<p>At low negativity, the proportions of negative review scores (1-star, 2-stars, 3-stars) and positive review scores (4-stars, 5-stars) are about equal, implying that negative reviews can be just as civil as positive reviews. But high negativity is solely present in 1-star and 2-star reviews.</p>

<p>From this article, you&rsquo;ve seen that Yelp reviews with 5-star ratings are generally positive, and Yelp reviews with 1-star are generally negative. Yes, this blog post is essentially &ldquo;Pretty Charts Made By Captain Obvious,&rdquo; but what&rsquo;s important is confirmation of these assumptions. Language plays a huge role in determining the ratings of reviews, and that knowledge could be applied to many other industries and review websites.</p>

<h1><span><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i></span></h1>

<p>I&rsquo;d give this blog post a solid 4-stars. The content was great, but the length was long, although not as long as <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/06/reviewing-reviews/">some others</a>. Can&rsquo;t wait to read this post again!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
<li><em>Yelp reviews were preprocessed with Python, by simultaneously converting the data from JSON to a tabular structure, tokenizing the words in the review, counting the positive/negative words, and storing bigrams and trigrams in a dictionary to later be exported for creaitng word clouds.</em></li>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/08/comments-about-comments/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-08T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/08/comments-about-comments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year, the Federal Communications Commission, one of the governmental entities which polices the Internet in the United States, announced significant rule changes to the policy of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/openinternet">Open Internet</a>.&rdquo; Open Internet, more commonly known as &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">net neutrality</a>,&rdquo; helps businesses facilitate competition and promote innovation on the internet, which help improve the internet as a whole. However, the proposed rule changes allow internet service providers (ISPs) to discriminate between different types of internet traffic (a &ldquo;fast lane&rdquo; for video and social media, for example).  Said pricing discrimination may end up affecting the consumers instead (e.g. paying $10/month for access to Facebook), which may reduce innovation due to increased costs to the consumers of internet bandwidth, i.e. the average American citizen.</p>

<p>The FCC recently <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/comments">opened up a comment period</a>, where the U.S. public can <a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/upload/display?z=s6uf0">send or e-mail comments</a> on the changes to this policy. Naturally, the consumers of the internet reacted strongly. By August 2014, over <em>1.1 million comments</em> have been received by the FCC.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-words-small.png"></p>

<p>This week, the FCC <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/fcc-makes-open-internet-comments-more-accessible-public">released a dataset</a> of about <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/files/ecfs/14-28/ecfs-files.htm">450,000 of these comments</a>. Looking at the data behind these comments, it&rsquo;s clear to see that the entire country is passionate against the rule changes to net neutrality.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a timeline of when comments about net neutrality were sent to the FCC:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-timeline-annotated.png"></p>

<p>There are clear spikes after important initiatives for awareness of the FCC&rsquo;s ruling. May 15th marked the <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-resources">beginning of the Open Comment period</a> for the FCC&rsquo;s new guidelines, June 3rd marked the week after an airing of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which contained an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU">anti-net-neutrality rant</a> which went viral for the rest of the week. July 15th marked the close of the Open Comment period, which is why on July 14th, the internet rallied and sent in over a hundred thousand comments, which <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/fcc-extends-net-neutrality-open-comment-deadline-friday-article-1.1868238#kDMozMu84rJ5TPsl.97">crashed their servers</a> and forced them to extend the deadline.</p>

<p>But as with many awareness campaigns over the internet, this campaign may have &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism">slacktivists</a>&rdquo;, as evidenced by the flat lines after the events where people stopped writing comments. How much effort did the U.S. people actually put into their submissions? One way to tell is to check the length of the submissions.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-comment-length.png"></p>

<p>Many comments were one-liners at about 20 words each, and many comments were multiparagraph notes at about 180 words each. But why is there a giant spike at about 300 words?</p>

<p>As it turns out, there were over 100,000 comments with exactly 1,477 characters (approximately 290 words). That number of characters (before cleaning) corresponds to a comment following this template:</p>

<blockquote><p>Net neutrality is the First Amendment of the Internet, the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) treat all data equally. As an Internet user, net neutrality is vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.</p>

<p>Most Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable company. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves competition and choice.</p>

<p>Without net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able to manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down others. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.</p>

<p>It also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and slow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field. When ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup attract investors?</p>

<p>My friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for work and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are attacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won&rsquo;t stand for it.</p>

<p>ISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC&rsquo;s net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let&rsquo;s not be fooled again. Title II is the strong, legally sound way to enforce net neutrality. Use it.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the default template for a submission at the <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com">Battle for Net Neutrality</a> website. That means over about &frac14;th of the comments in the dataset, and atleast 1/10th of all comments submitted, used this website&rsquo;s submission form.</p>

<h1>Comments Across the Nation</h1>

<p>Net neutrality affects some individuals more than others. Not everyone in the U.S. may be as passionate over the issue, and many may not even be aware that such a threat to the modern internet even exists.</p>

<p>Which cities in the United States sent the most comments to the FCC?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-city.png"></p>

<p>Yes, Brooklyn, NY counts as a city according to the FCC.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that the three most populated cities in the U.S. (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago) top this chart due to the higher potential number of commenters. What is surprising yet important is that tech hubs with much fewer populations, such as San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland, all have extremely strong showings.</p>

<p>When you look at the distribution of comments by state of origin, it&rsquo;s even more apparent that California and Washington are some of the key drivers of the comments. (admittingly, it does resemble a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1138/">population map</a>)</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-state-map.png"></p>

<p>What are the key words mentioned in the comments to the FCC?</p>

<p>The key players in who would benefit the most from the implementation of net neutrality are <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> and <a href="http://www.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>, two of the biggest ISPs in the country. Which states have been speaking out the most against these institutions?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-state-map-comcast.png"></p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-state-map-verizon.png"></p>

<p>Comcast is a frequent topic of discussion (5.2% of all comments about net neutrality contain atleast 1 mention of Comcast), especially on the West Coast. On the other hand, less than half as many talk about Verizon (2.0% of all comments), except on the East Coast.</p>

<p>Although not on the map, Washington, DC actually had the most to comment on these two topics, with 11.7% comments having atleast one mention of Comcast and 8.8% of comments having atleast one mention of Verizon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, an internet video-streaming service which would likely be negatively impacted by the FCC ruling, was also discussed.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-state-map-netflix.png"></p>

<p>Discussion of Netflix from all around the country is very evenly distributed (2.1% of all comments), potentially because it&rsquo;s not location-specific as the presence of an ISP. (Montana apparently does not care much about Netflix.)</p>

<p>Another concern about net neutrality is the potential <a href="https://www.aclu.org/net-neutrality">fight against the First Amendment</a> and free speech itself, as ISPs could theoretically restrict traffic to unfavorable websites under the system. Which states are most passionate about free speech?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fcc/fcc-state-map-free-speech.png"></p>

<p>Much more activity in the Midwest and especially the North West than the previous maps. (2.1% of all comments discuss &ldquo;free speech&rdquo;) North Dakota apparently is relatively indifferent about the freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, at this period of time, it&rsquo;s hard to guess if the hundreds of thousands of comments sent to the FCC will actually cause them to reconsider their plans. The sheer quantity of comments, at the least, lets the FCC know that Americans feel strongly about the issue. It&rsquo;s clear that in the worst-case scenario where the ISPs win the net neutrality battle, the consumers of the internet in the United States <strong>will not remain passive</strong>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The Wikipedia Entries Which Are Most-Edited by Members of the U.S. Congress]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/07/caucus-needed/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-15T08:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/07/caucus-needed</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/congressedits">@congressedits</a> launched. This account is a bot that tweets edits to Wikipedia that were made by members of the U.S. Congress, in order to help <a href="http://inkdroid.org/journal/2014/07/10/why-congressedits/">facilitate transparency</a>. The account <a href="https://github.com/edsu/anon">works</a> by automatically tweeting any Wikipedia edits made by anonymous contributors with IP addresses between the known IP address blocks of the <a href="http://whois.arin.net/rest/org/USSAA/nets">U.S. Senate</a> or the <a href="http://whois.arin.net/rest/org/ISUHR/nets">House of Representatives</a>.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a> tool has a <a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataset-wikipedia">sample dataset</a> of Wikipedia data, representing the data on 314 million article edits up to April 2010. Out of curiosity, I wrote a query which returns the top 100 pages with the most amount of edits by Wikipedia contributors in the U.S. Senate&rsquo;s IP block.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/caucus-needed/senate-query.png"></p>

<p>Using this query for the Senate&rsquo;s IP block, and a similar one for the House of Representatives IP blocks, I retrieved the most-edited entries for both entities. You can access the spreadsheet of this data by <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2017402/Congress_Wikipedia_Edits.pdf">downloading a .pdf</a> or by viewing the data online with <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BALY8siqBP4jYZq5E2OB20P-wlPpyXdycqqF/Congress_Wikipedia_Edits">Numbers for iCloud</a>, both of which contain high-resolution charts and clickable Wikipedia links. A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qfFEwzNzc4KL4gqe2i4IoMO0ksmoYndCK0O0m46n37I/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets</a> version is also available.</p>

<p>Here are the Top 10 Wikipedia entries with the most amount of edits by members of the Senate:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/caucus-needed/senate-wikipedia.png"></p>

<p>Wait a minute. Hawk from G.I. Joe?!</p>

<p>Saying that the query results were surprising would be the understatement of the century.</p>

<p>Two of the top-edited entries are directly pertaining to the U.S. Senate, which helps prove that the IP block is indeed the Senate&rsquo;s IP block. Both Kappa Upsilon Chi and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Upsilon_Chi">Beta Upsilon Chi</a> are Christian fraternities. (however, the Kappa Upsilon Chi Wikipedia entry no longer exists for some reason)</p>

<p>The edits corresponding to actual people are ones which are the most interesting. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Swain_Lee">William Swain Lee</a> is a Delaware politician whose entry was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Swain_Lee&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31202175">created and edited</a> by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/156.33.148.107">user in the Senate IP block</a>. OrangePie is  a user who, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7319910">according to his talk page</a>, was criticized for repeatedly recreating an entry for &ldquo;Michael Hardaway&rdquo; after deletion, who coincidentally worked for the Senate <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelhardaway">according to his Twitter bio</a>. In journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8593106">Paul D. Thacker&rsquo;s</a> entry, one Senate editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_D._Thacker&amp;diff=311839513&amp;oldid=311689066">replaced a paragraph</a> of Thacker&rsquo;s biography with the word &ldquo;anus?&rdquo;. Jay Rockefeller is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337026">actual U.S. Senator</a>, so the edits are definitely a conflict of interest. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/156.33.96.28">user who made the edits</a> apparently also removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Rockefeller&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33857327">information about a government investigation</a> into the Senator.</p>

<p>I have nothing to add for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2814171">Hawk from G.I. Joe</a>.</p>

<p>Other interesting frequently-edited Wikipedia entries from members of the U.S. Senate are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3626593">Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Comedy Series</a> (11 edits), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1226609">Wikipedia:Introduction</a> (5 edits) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1749535">Crash (2004 film)</a> (5 edits)</p>

<p>The Wikipedia entries with the most amount of edits by members of the House of Representatives are somehow even <em>weirder</em>, and that&rsquo;s quite an accomplishment.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/caucus-needed/house-wikipedia.png"></p>

<p>Well, if <em>anyone</em> in the entire United States would be experts on the topics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2352587">cleft chins</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1924543">dimples</a>, it would be the members of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Again, one of the most-edited entries corresponds to a House of Representatives topic, which helps validate the IP blocks. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=107610">Cerritos, California</a> location had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cerritos,_California&amp;diff=21384826&amp;oldid=21363395">neutral edits</a> made by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/143.231.249.141">rather dedicated Wikiuser</a>. Wynne, Arkansas and Michelle Ye&rsquo;s edits were made by the same dedicated Wikiuser. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1143590">Waverly, Pennsylvania</a> was edited by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/137.18.255.33">user</a> who&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waverly,_Pennsylvania&amp;diff=7763793&amp;oldid=7761053">really passionate about Doc&rsquo;s Deli</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1129560">Luis Fortuno</a>, former governor of Puerto Rico, had his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luis_Fortu%C3%B1o&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=134653411">history excised</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/143.231.249.137">another user</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6260346">Betty Sutton</a>, however, is a actual Representative from Ohio, representing another conflict of interest, as another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/143.228.129.9">user</a> constructed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Betty_Sutton&amp;diff=303743778&amp;oldid=296652449">most of her entry</a>.</p>

<p>I have nothing to add regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=862471">effeminacy</a> in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Other interesting edits by members of the House include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18951054">Apocalypse Now</a> (10 edits), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1161298">History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars</a> (9 edits), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34071">Whitney Houston</a> (9 edits)</p>

<p>In the end, the members of the U.S. Congress have the same peculiar interests as typical Americans. However, when these people edit entries on topics in which they are directly involved, the potential bias threatens the integrity of all Wikipedia. And this is just the tip of the iceburg.</p>

<p>Did this feature help or harm Show HN submissions as a whole?</p>

<p>Over the past few years, the average number of Show HN submissions per day has steadily risen. (this is strongly correlated with the <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/hacking-hacker-news/">growth of Hacker News as a whole</a>)</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/show-hn/show-hn-submissions.png"></p>

<p>More on that spike at the end later.</p>

<p>On Hacker News, users can upvote link submissions, which increases the point score of the submission; this point score is used as a rough proxy of link quality. The average amount of points per submission peaked in 2012, and has trended downward since then.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart of the points of Show HN submissions averaged by date of submission, then averaged across the previous 30-days to further smooth the variation and make the trend more apparent:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/show-hn/show-hn-points.png"></p>

<p>Users can also comment on these Show HN posts. The average amount of comments has trended downward over time, albeit only slightly.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/show-hn/show-hn-comments.png"></p>

<p>The combination of increased Show HN submissions and a decrease in point quality over time may imply that Show HN submissions have a low signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. a low amount of good submissions relative high amount of bad submissions.</p>

<p>Hitting the front page of Hacker News is the first step to virality. When users upvote submissions on Hacker News, those submissions can hit the front page after achieving enough points (combined with other factors, such as submission age and quantity of other submissions). At the least, if a submission has 10 points, it has most likely hit the front page sometime in its lifespan.</p>

<p>What proportion of the Show HN submissions hit the front page?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/show-hn/show-hn-perc-front.png"></p>

<p>Over time, the amount of good Show HNs relative to the amount of bad Show HNs has been steadily decreasing.</p>

<p>Has the new Show HN feature helped improve the signal-to-noise ratio?</p>

<h1>Show and Tell HN</h1>

<p>We can look at the immediate impact of the new Show HN section by comparing the behavior of submissions before and after the announcement. The red area in the following charts represents the daily behavior in the couple months before the release (with the red horizontal dotted line representing the statistical average for the corresponding measurement), and the blue area/blue line represents the behavior after the release.</p>

<p>When the Show HN feature was first announced, everyone rushed to make a submission to test it out, and it showed. In fact, the number of submissions for every day after the feature was added was greater than the average number of submissions from before the addition.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/show-hn/show-hn-end-submissions.png"></p>

<p>Average number of daily submissions before Show HN section is <strong>19.13</strong> submissions/day, average after is <strong>53.44</strong> submissions/day.</p>

<p>Average submission points and average submission comments (both aggregated by date of submission for smoothing) received a slight boost too.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/show-hn/show-hn-end-points.png"></p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/show-hn/show-hn-end-comments.png"></p>

<p>Average number of daily points before Show HN section is <strong>11.40</strong> points/submission/day, average after is <strong>12.12</strong> points/submission/day.</p>

<p>Average number of daily comments before Show HN section is <strong>6.57</strong> comments/submission/day, average after is <strong>7.16</strong> comments/submission/day.</p>

<p>The percentage of Show HN submissions that hit the front page, however, moves in a different direction.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/show-hn/show-hn-end-perc-front.png"></p>

<p>Average daily % of Show HN submissions which hit the front page before Show HN section is <strong>19.33%</strong>, average after is <strong>16.37%</strong>.</p>

<p>While the Show HN section gives more focus to Show HN submissions, the increased motivation for making Show HN submissions does not necessarily imply that the submissions will be better. It will take more time to see of the downward trend of Show HN quality continues over time.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/07/online-class-charts/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-10T08:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/07/online-class-charts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of May, <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> jointly <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/mit-and-harvard-release-de-identified-learning-data-open-online-courses">released a dataset</a> containing statistics about their online courses in the Academic Year of 2013. This <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/26147">Person-Course De-Identified dataset</a> contains 641,138 events, chronicling 476,532 students who have taken up to 13 unique courses from a variety of topics:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/gender-course/mit-harvard-courses.png"></p>

<p>However, this assortment of courses is not a substitution for a typical college education, as the vast majority of students only take one class.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/student-courses.png"></p>

<p>Very, very few students take more than one class (22% of all students).</p>

<p>Other interesting variables included with the data set are the level-of-education of the student, the birth date of the student, the gender of the student, and the geographical location of student.</p>

<p>Which types of student characteristics lead to the best performance in these online classes? That depends on how you define &ldquo;performance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at the attendance of all the classes:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/class-attendance.png"></p>

<p>Harvard&rsquo;s Introduction to Computer Science is by far the most popular class, and that&rsquo;s only accounting for one semester. (it still beat MIT&rsquo;s Intro to CS/Programming, which had 2 semesters).</p>

<p>Each color bar indicates the level of student participation in the class. <strong>Registered</strong> means the student simply registered for the class; <strong>Viewed</strong> means that the student viewed some of the course material, <strong>Explored</strong> means that students viewed atleast half of the course material, and <strong>Certified</strong> means that students completed the course and received a certificate of accomplishment. For the chart, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that most classes have a high percentage of people in each class who simply register just for fun and <em>don&rsquo;t actually do anything.</em></p>

<p>One metric of course success is the completion rate of each course, i.e. how many people actually complete the course after starting it. A frequent criticism of free online classes is that this number is very low, but what are the actual completion rates of these 13 classes?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/class-perc-finished.png"></p>

<p>Completion rates are low across the board, from 0.8% to 7.5%. A <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/10/new-study-low-mooc-completion-rates">2013 study</a> found that completion rate is less than 7%, which this data follows. Apparently, Challenges of Global Poverty is a very interesting course.</p>

<p>After the student completes a class, he or she receives a final grade, and if the grade is above the cutoff point (usually 50% &ndash; 80%), they will complete the class and receive the certificate. Here&rsquo;s the distribution of the average grades for students in each class, given that the student has successfully completed the class:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/class-perc-grade.png"></p>

<p>The grades vary significantly between classes. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply that some classes are harder than others; it&rsquo;s possible some classes had lower cutoffs and therefore the effort put in by the students is lower. However, the perfect 100% average for Harvard&rsquo;s Intro to CS course implies that the class is pass/fail and that students can&rsquo;t get a final grade less than 100%. (as a result, we&rsquo;ll need to remove that class from future grade analyses in order to prevent bias due to the lack of score variance)</p>

<h1>Age</h1>

<p>Online classes are marketed toward college-age students.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/student-age.png"></p>

<p>The mean age is about <strong>27.7</strong>, with a standard deviation of 8.89. The shape skews right and resembles a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution">gamma distribution</a>. There are even plenty of teenagers taking these classes too.</p>

<p>The proportion of students who take more than one class for each age group has a slightly flatter distribution, although more centralized at students in their 20&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/student-num-classes.png"></p>

<p>What about completion rate?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/student-fulfillment.png"></p>

<p>Completion rate is a little more evenly distributed between the ages, indicating that the two metrics are  likely uncorrelated. However, the older students have nearly double the completion rate of classes. (more on this later)</p>

<h1>Education</h1>

<p>One of the student-provided attributes is his or her highest level of education. These values are &ldquo;Less than Secondary,&rdquo; &ldquo;Secondary&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bachelor&rsquo;s&rdquo;, &ldquo;Master&rsquo;s&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Doctorate.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s the distribution of the 409,601 students who provided their LoE:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/education-count.png"></p>

<p>This shows that the majority of students who are taking these online classes have already finished college and already obtained a degree, and therefore are likely taking the course as supplemental material.</p>

<p>We can correlate the levels of education with the average age for each LoE as a double-check.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/education-age.png"></p>

<p>Indeed, each LoE average age is above the minimum expected threshold of time needed for each degree (~18 years for Secondary, ~22 years for Bachelor&rsquo;s, etc.)</p>

<p>How does the completion rate vary?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/education-fulfillment.png"></p>

<p>Interestingly, those with Less than Secondary education have a much higher completion rate than those with Secondary educations and Bachelor&rsquo;s Degrees.</p>

<p>But are Doctorate smarter than those with lower education levels? Do they get higher grades on average?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/education-grade.png"></p>

<p>As it turns out, yes. The education level of a student is very relevant to a his or her academic performance in online classes.</p>

<h1>Gender</h1>

<p>I previously <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/07/gender-course/">made a blog post</a> discussing the genders of students and the proportion of students by course. As it turns out, gender is a very important part of the student body composition.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/gender-count.png"></p>

<p>425,108 students have a gender on record, with 311,534 male students (73.3%) and 113,571 female students (26.7%). The fact that it&rsquo;s not even close to 50:50 is surprising.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/gender-age.png"></p>

<p>Age wise, there&rsquo;s not much difference between the genders. Female students are about a year older than male students on average.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/gender-completion.png"></p>

<p>Completion rate varies a bit more. Female students finish classes more frequently than male students.</p>

<p>Now to answer the age-old question: who get better grades: men or women?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/gender-grade.png"></p>

<p>Ok, it&rsquo;s a tie.</p>

<h1>Country</h1>

<p>The home location of the students is, in my opinion, the most interesting student attribute in the data set. There are 24 different countries which were specified among 325,012 different students.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/country-count.png"></p>

<p>The United States, as one of the more technologically-savvy countries, accounts for nearly 1/3rd of all online students. India has a very strong presence as well due to  the combination of population and accessibility of materials. All the other countries have significantly fewer students.</p>

<p>Given such accessibility of online classes, students in some countries take more classes than others.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/country-more-than-one.png"></p>

<p>India&rsquo;s students also take the most classes on average.</p>

<p>The United States also has the oldest students on average among all the countries.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/country-age.png"></p>

<p>Completion rate by country, however, is very, very significant.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/country-completion.png"></p>

<p>The top seven countries with the highest rate of completion are <strong>all European countries</strong>, with Spain and Poland in particular having a higher rate of completion than all the other countries, and nearly <strong>four times</strong> the completion rate of the United States.</p>

<p>But which country has the students which get the best grades?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/online-class-charts/country-grade.png"></p>

<p>China is at the top with 86%, but otherwise the distribution is fairly flat with no outliers, and no economic or demographical pattern to the top or bottom of the ranks. It&rsquo;s possible that the more structured format of the classes make it harder to skew.</p>

<p>This Person-Course dataset has helped reveal many interesting insights about online classes at Harvard and MIT. Whether you measure performance by % of classes completed or a % score received at the end of the class, it&rsquo;s clear that age, country, and level of education all have a statistically significant impact on performance. The impact of the student&rsquo;s gender on performance, however, is more ambiguous and could use further analysis.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of May, <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> jointly <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/mit-and-harvard-release-de-identified-learning-data-open-online-courses">released a dataset</a> containing statistics about their online courses in the Academic Year of 2013. This <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/26147">Person-Course De-Identified dataset</a> contains 476,532 students who have taken up to 13 unique courses from a variety of topics:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/gender-course/mit-harvard-courses.png"></p>

<p>About half of the courses involve subjects in the humanities, while the other half involve computer science and electrical engineering.</p>

<p>One of the statistics I wanted to analyze was the gender ratio of students of online courses. In the data set, 425,105 students have a gender on record, with 311,534 male students (73.3%) and 113,571 female students (26.7%). This population proportion of female students is surprisingly low, especially since the male/female ratio is <a href="http://colleges.findthebest.com/q/1929/1270/What-is-the-male-to-female-ratio-at-Harvard-University">about 50:50</a> at MIT and Harvard themselves.</p>

<p>Therefore, I took a looked at the gender distribution of each of the 13 unique courses. Is the gender ratio similar across all classes, or is there a huge difference between classes?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/gender-course/course-female.png"></p>

<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a huge difference.</p>

<p>The proportion of female students in each of Harvard and MIT&rsquo;s online courses range from <strong>5% to 49%</strong>.</p>

<p>The top half of the gender ratios are all well above the 26.7%  threshold. All six of these courses are in the humanities or in the life sciences. The bottom half of the gender ratio are all well below the 26.7% threshold. All seven are these courses are engineering or computer science courses with a strong focus on mathematics. (for clarification, the <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-2-01x-elements-structures-1759#.U7ZfKvldV8F">Elements of Structures</a> course at MIT is a physics course with linear algebra programming)</p>

<p>Is there a correlation? As it turns out, the reason that the average proportion of female students is so low is that both Harvard&rsquo;s Introduction to Computer Science I  (where 169,621 students took the class; about 40% of all students) and MIT&rsquo;s Introduction to CS/Programming (124,446 students total across both semesters) are so popular that the low percentage of women in those particular classes is drastically affecting the average.</p>

<p>The presence and interest of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/women">women in STEM fields</a> (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) has been a topic of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stella-kasdagli/should-women-avoid-jobs-in-stem_b_5549016.html">controversy</a> for a very long time. However, the chart shows that indeed the percentage of women interested in STEM classes is measurably lower than other fields, and hopefully awareness of this issue will help cause changes in the future.</p>

    <updated>2014-06-17T08:20:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/06/reviewing-reviews</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When buying the latest products on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, reading reviews is an important part of the purchasing process.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/ore.png"></p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amazon-review.png"></p>

<p>Customer reviews from customers who have actually purchased and used the product in question can give you more context to the product itself. Each reviewer rates the product from 1 to 5 stars, and provides a text summary of their experiences and opinions about the product. The ratings for each product are averaged together in order to get an overall product rating.</p>

<p>The number of reviews on Amazon has grown over the years.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-basic-time-count.png"></p>

<p>But how do people write reviews? What types of ratings do reviewers give? How many of these reviews are considered helpful?</p>

<p>Stanford researchers Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec collected <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html">all Amazon reviews </a>from the service&rsquo;s online debut in 1995 to 2013. Analyzing the dataset of 1.2 million Amazon reviews of products in the Electronics section, I found some interesting statistical trends; some are intuitive and obvious, but others give insight to how Amazon&rsquo;s review system actually works.</p>

<h1>Describing the Data</h1>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s see how the user ratings are distributed among the reviews.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-basic-score.png"></p>

<p>More than half of the reviews give a 5-star rating. Aside from perfect reviews, most reviewers give 4-star or 1-star ratings, with <em>very</em> few giving 2-stars or 3-stars relatively.</p>

<p>As as result, the statistical average for all review ratings is on the high-end of the scale at about <strong>3.90</strong>.  In fact, the average review rating for newly-written reviews has varied from 3.4 to 4.2 over time.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-basic-time-rating.png"></p>

<p>Another metric used to measure reviews is review helpfulness. Other Amazon reviewers can rate a particular review as &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; or &ldquo;not helpful.&rdquo; A &ldquo;review helpfulness&rdquo; statistic can be calculated by taking the number of &ldquo;is-helpful&rdquo; indicators divided by the total number of is-helpful/is-not-helpful indicators (in the example at the beginning of the article, 639/665 people found the review helpful, so the helpfulness rating would be 96%). This gives an indication of review quality to a prospective buyer. Only 10% of the reviews had atleast 10 is-helpful/is-not-helpful data points, and of those reviews, the vast majority of the reviews had perfect helpfulness scores.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-basic-helpful.png"></p>

<p>That would make sense; if you&rsquo;re writing a review (especially a 5 star review), you&rsquo;re writing with the intent to help other prospective buyers.</p>

<p>Another consideration is review length. Do reviews frequently write essays, or do reviews typically write a single paragraph?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-basic-length.png"></p>

<p>Most reviews are 100-150 characters, but the average amount of characters in a review is about <strong>582</strong> (there are some outlier reviews with 30,000+ characters!). Assuming that the average amount of characters in a paragraph <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_characters_does_the_average_paragraph_have">is 352</a>, reviewers typically write about half a paragraph. Interestingly, reviews are rarely less than a sentence. (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/customer-reviews-guidelines">Review Guidelines</a> suggest a minimum of 20 words in a review, so this discrepancy could be attributed to moderator removal of short, one-liner reviews)</p>

<h1>Particularizing the Products</h1>

<p>The 1.2 million reviews in the Electronics data set address about 82,003 distinct products. However, most of those entries represent different SKUs of the same product (e.g. different colors of headphones). Of those products, only 30,577 products have pricing information which identify them as the source product.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-product-price.png"></p>

<p>Over 2/3rds of Amazon Electronics are priced between $0 and $50, which makes sense as popular electronics such as television remotes and phone cases are not extremely expensive. However, there&rsquo;s no statistical correlation between the price of a product and the number of reviews it receives.</p>

<p>For the overall rating of a particular product, which is the average rating of all reviews for that product, the ratings are no longer limited to discrete numbers between 1 and 5, and can take decimal values between those numbers as well. The distribution of product ratings is similar to the distribution of review ratings.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-product-rating.png"></p>

<p>Again, the perfect rating of 5 is most popular for products. This distribution resembles the distribution of scores of all reviews for the discrete rating values, but this view reveals local maxima at the midpoint between each discrete value. (i.e. 3-and-a-half stars and 4-and-a-half stars are surprisingly common ratings)</p>

<p>What happens when you plot product rating and product price together?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-product-score-price.png"></p>

<p>The most expensive products have 4-star and 5-star overall ratings, but not 1-star and 2-star ratings. However, the correlation is very weak. (r = 0.04)</p>

<p>In contrast, the relationship between product price and the average <em>length</em> of reviews for the product is surprising.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-product-price-length.png"></p>

<p>This relationship is logarithmic with a relatively good correlation (r = 0.29), and it shows that reviewers put more time and effort into reviewing products which are worth more.</p>

<h1>Reviewing the Reviewers</h1>

<p>As you might expect, most people leave only 1 or 2 reviews on Amazon, but some have left <em>hundreds</em> of reviews. Out of 1.2 Million reviews, there are 510,434 distinct reviewers.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-reviewer-count.png"></p>

<p>Over 80% of the reviewers of Amazon electronics left only 1 review. Analyzing reviewers who have left only 1 review is not helpful statistically, so for the rest of the analysis, only reviews who have made 5 or more reviews (which have received atleast 1 is-helpful/is-not-helpful indicator) will be considered. This makes it much easier to get the overall profile of a reviewer. 11,676 reviewers fit this criteria.</p>

<p>Do repeat Amazon users tend to give 5-star reviews?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-reviewer-score.png"></p>

<p>Distribution of review ratings when averaged across is similar to the other distributions of review ratings. However, this distribution is less skewed toward 5-stars and is more uniform between 4-stars and 5-stars.</p>

<p>What about the average helpfulness of the reviews written by a single reviewer? If a reviewer has enjoyed Amazon enough such that they make 5 or more reviews, chances are that their reviews are high quality.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-reviewer-helpfulness.png"></p>

<p>Again, the data is slightly skewed. 8% of the reviewers have perfect helpfulness scores on all their reviews, and the average helpfulness score for all repeat reviews is 80%. Interestingly, a few repeat reviewers have average helpfulness scores of 0.</p>

<p>If you plot <em>both</em> average score and average helpfulness in a single chart, the picture becomes much more clear:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-reviewer-count-score.png"></p>

<p>As the chart shows, there&rsquo;s a good positive correlation (r = 0.27) between rating and helpfulness, with a discernible cluster at the top. However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a causal relationship. Reviewers who give a product a 4 &ndash; 5 star rating are more passionate about the product and likely to write better reviews than someone who writes a 1 &ndash; 2 star &ldquo;this product sucks and you suck too!&rdquo; review.</p>

<p>Another interesting bivariate relationship is the relationship between the helpfulness of a review and the length of a review). Stereotypically, you might think that longer reviews are more helpful reviews. And in the case of Amazon&rsquo;s Electronics reviews, you&rsquo;d be correct.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/amazon/amzn-reviewer-helpful-length.png"></p>

<p>Again, there&rsquo;s a good positive correlation (r = 0.26) between average helpfulness and average length, which the trend line supports. (the dip at the end is caused by the high amount of low-character reviews). All the longer reviews have high helpfulness; there are very, very few unhelpful reviews that are also long.</p>

<h1>Completing the Conclusion</h1>

<p>The reviews on Amazon&rsquo;s Electronics products very frequently rate the product 4 or 5 stars, and such reviews are almost always considered helpful. 1-stars are used to signify disapproval, and 2-star and 3-stars reviews have no significant impact at all. If that&rsquo;s the case, then what&rsquo;s the point of having a 5 star ranking system at all if the vast majority of reviewers favor the product? Would Amazon benefit if they made review ratings a binary like/dislike?</p>

<p>Having a 5-star system can allow the prospective customer to make more informed comparisons between two products: a customer may be more likely to buy a product that&rsquo;s rated 4.2 stars than a product that is rated 3.8 stars, which is a subtlety that can&rsquo;t easily be emulated with a like/dislike system. Likewise, if products are truly bad, the propensity toward 5-star reviews can help obfuscate the low quality of the product when a like/dislike system would make the low quality more apparent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, only Amazon has the data that would answer all these questions.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many other secrets to be uncovered from Amazon reviews. The Stanford professors who collected the initial data used <a href="http://i.stanford.edu/~julian/pdfs/recsys13.pdf">machine learning techniques on the review text</a> to predict the rating given by a review from just the review text itself. Other potential topics for analysis are comparisons between <em>types</em> of Electronics (e.g. MP3 players, headphones) or using natural language processing to determine the common syntax in reviews.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Statisticians like to use data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/">United States Census</a> to plot interesting trends such as unemployment and population of regions across the country. However, such data is typically historical and not very robust.</p>

<p>Facebook, on the other hand, has collected a large amount of data though its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/location">Places product</a>. Facebook Places allows users to &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; a place such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dolores-Park/105687759464007">Dolores Park</a> in a manner similar to <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/dolores.png"></p>

<p>Through clever use of Facebook&rsquo;s Graph API and FQL, I was able to retrieve the data on all Facebook Places in and around San Francisco, along with the # of check-ins at each Place. With the data on approximately 8,000 Facebook Places in San Francisco, we can map where San Franciscans are checking-in, and determine what types of locations they like to visit.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the distribution of check-ins among Places in San Francisco:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-checkin-distribution.png"></p>

<p>On a logarithmic scale, the shape resembles a bell curve with a center at about 800 check-ins; however, the sample average of check-ins for the data set is <strong>3,241 check-ins</strong>, indicating that the data may be heavily skewed to the right. Some Places don&rsquo;t have many check-ins, while some Places have an incredibly large number of check-ins.</p>

<p>What are the Places with hundreds of thousands of check-ins? What does the city look like with all these Places plotted on a map of San Francisco?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-checkin.png"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cykofhlyus8atgw/sf-bubble.pdf">(PDF of Map)</a></em></p>

<p>The most checked-in Places are, unsurprisingly, the famous tourist attractions of San Francisco, such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ATT-Park/116440731717551">AT&amp;T Park</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UnionSquareSF">Union Square</a>. These Top Places are spread all over the city.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also clear where the most dense areas are located in San Francisco. There are plainly-visible lines of Places along southern Mission Street and Outer Sunset. SOMA and Richmond have a large number of Places as well.</p>

<p>And yes, 155,000 people really did check-into <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Cheesecake-Factory/107178672654937">The Cheesecake Factory</a>.</p>

<h1>What types of locations do people in San Francisco  frequently check-into?</h1>

<p>Facebook also records the category of its Places, such as &ldquo;Bar&rdquo; and &ldquo;Restaurant&rdquo;. What are the most numerous types of locations in San Francisco?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-checkin-distribution-count.png"></p>

<p>Local businesses are by far the most frequent, as it&rsquo;s a more generic classifier for a Place and can be applied to anything that does not have an explicit classifier (such as startups). I find it interesting that non-profit organizations are more numerous than shopping centers.</p>

<p>However, the quantity of a specific type of business does not necessarily mean that San Franciscians will check-into that type of Place more often. Which type of Place, on average, receives the greatest number of check-ins?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-checkin-distribution-avg.png"></p>

<p>People are more likely to check-into memorable Places and events, instead of Places they frequently visit like Bars and Restaurants (Twice as many people check-into Attractions than Clubs). Again, tourist attractions are the most popular, which is due to both the relatively low number of Places and the extremely high number of check-ins into Places such as AT&amp;T Park.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Lake&rdquo; corresponds to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lake-Merced/113785468632283">Lake Merced</a>, if you&rsquo;re curious.</p>

<h1>Which San Francisco neighborhoods are the most popular?</h1>

<p>You saw earlier that the Facebook Places are concentrated in specific areas. Here&rsquo;s a map of San Francisco&rsquo;s neighborhoods, highlighted by the number of Places within:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-places-count.png"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/63fgvcucvk9n9v3/sf-sum.pdf">(PDF of Map)</a></em></p>

<p>The neighborhoods with the most Places are unsurprisingly where the trendy areas are, such as the Mission and SOMA. Additionally, those types of neighborhoods are larger in square area than others, which may bias the results in their favor.</p>

<p>But are these large neighborhoods also the most active neighborhoods? Which neighborhoods have the most check-ins on average per Place within the neighborhood?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-places-avg.png"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u613oh4fskjrkny/sf-avg.pdf">(PDF of Map)</a></em></p>

<p>The Embarcadero has by far the most check-ins on average, again, due to both its small size and AT&amp;T Park. Other neighborhoods, however, have more similar averages to each other. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the average number of check-ins is higher in neighborhoods adjacent to the San Francisco Bay, such as North Beach and Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf: perhaps people check-in more frequently when they have a good view.</p>

<p>Can this data and conclusions about San Francisco Facebook Places be extrapolated to other cities? I&rsquo;d argue yes: it makes logical sense that people check-in more frequently to Places that are more significant, and it also makes sense that people frequently check-into Places with large amounts of tourist attractions. Facebook data shows us cool trends that the United States Census data cannot.</p>

<p><em>All charts and maps were made using R, ggplot2, and ggmaps.</em></p>

<p><em>You can download a copy of the Facebook Places data set <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6g6ap4poz1b2trs/sf-public.csv">here</a>. The place_id column corresponds to the San Francisco neighborhood where the Place is located.</em></p>

<p><em>Maps are from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>.

Additionally, thanks to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/223ubt/map_of_places_in_san_francisco_by_of_facebook/">/r/dataisbeautiful</a> for offering ideas for improvements to the maps.</em></p>

<p><em>You may notice that the Check-In Counts on some of the official Facebook Place Pages strongly disagree with the Count reported in my charts. The Count reported on affected page is nearly double the value reported via the API in each instance. I believe this is a bug on Facebook&rsquo;s end: see <a href="http://i.imgur.com/I1syBhR.png">this image</a>, in which the Graph Search autocomplete reports a different value of check-ins than the Place Page itself. In this case, I trust the data from the API.</em></p>
