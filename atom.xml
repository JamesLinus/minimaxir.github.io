    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue_Versions">Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue</a> remain as two of the most iconic games in video gaming history. They have retained a lot of nostalgia value for those who grew up playing the games (such as myself), and nowadays even adult gamers revisit such classics.</p>

<p>On the game live-streaming site <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a>, one user simply known as &ldquo;TwitchPlaysPokemon&rdquo; setup <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon">a live-stream of Pokemon Red</a>, but with a twist: all game commands, such as &ldquo;up&rdquo;,&ldquo;down&rdquo;,&ldquo;left&rdquo;,&ldquo;right&rdquo;,&ldquo;b&rdquo;,&ldquo;a&rdquo;,&ldquo;select&rdquo;, and &ldquo;start&rdquo;, would be input by typing the appropriate command into the livestream chat. At first, this seems like a crazy idea: if thousands of people are inputting commands at the same time, could we accomplish <em>anything</em> in the game?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/AcXmBbM.png"></p>

<p>As it turns out, it was an idea that had gone horribly right. By the time gaming forum NeoGAF <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=768965">found the stream</a>, the channel had made an unexpected amount of progress; a group of 3,000 viewes made it past the first Gym (out of eight) and continued to move forward. A few days later, after the channel was covered by <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/17/5420334/twitch-plays-pokemon-captivates-with-more-than-6-5m-total-views">major news outlets</a>, the channel had completed <em>four</em> gyms, inspired the creation of a large amount of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Luwz9wr8XkoekzU4zv3duj9D2K5AoAyqnYMcbCHZKqc">hilarious fan art</a>, and also created a <a href="http://askhelixfossil.com/">new religion</a>. You can read a summary of the stream&rsquo;s status <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/minimaxir.com/document/d/1Ka89uCBeLl9VV5GPlAKuW7yF8FGtnVmdbPnIwG8FnQ4/preview?pli=1&amp;sle=true">here</a>.</p>

<p>That being said, it was neither a straight nor short path to success. In the end, the gaming community fought its greatest enemy: itself. Twitch Plays Pokemon isn&rsquo;t about winning. It&rsquo;s about trying not to fail spectacularly. And they still fail regardless. It&rsquo;s an irresistible train wreck that&rsquo;s hard to stop watching.</p>

<h1>The Adventure Begins</h1>

<p>The first areas of Pokemon Red are relatively linear up until <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vermilion_City">Vermilion City</a>, where the third gym is located. Before that, Pokemon Trainer Red, the player character, had a few interesting encounters thanks to the bizarre overlords of the Twitch chat. Red chose <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charmander">Charmander</a> (later evolved into <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charmeleon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Charmeleon</a>) as his starter Pokemon, which he nicknamed <strong>ABBBBBBK (</strong> or &ldquo;Abby&rdquo; for short. He caught a few more basic Pokemon, including a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pidgey">Pidgey</a> (later evolved into <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pidgeotto_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Pidgeotto</a>) and <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pidgeot_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Pidgeot</a>), 2 <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rattata">Rattata</a> (one nicknamed <strong>JLVWNNOOOO</strong>, i.e. &ldquo;Jay Leno&rdquo;), a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Drowzee">Drowzee</a>, and a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Spearow">Spearow</a> which was traded for a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Farfetch%27d">Farfetch&rsquo;d</a>, all of which gave him a full party of Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/MwarCER.png"></p>

<p>Since thousands of players are inputting commands at the same time, there is absolutely no strategy involved in Pokemon battles, which in most cases make the battles unwinnable. Thanks to the nature of RPG level-ups and a few lucky critical hits, Red can still persevere (although it will a few hours).</p>

<p>The Twitch channel was a very casual experience, until Red obtained HM 01 from the <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/S.S._Anne">S.S. Anne</a>, an item that requires a sequence of sequential button presses to operate.</p>

<p>Then things get complicated.</p>

<h1>Cutting A Thin Line</h1>

<p>HM 01 is an item that grants the Cut ability to a Pokemon, which is required to cut trees blocking progress; in this case, the tree in front of the Vermilion City Gym. In order to teach a Pokemon Cut, the player must:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring up the Start menu.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Items.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Select HM 01.</li>
<li>Confirm that HM 01 is to be used.</li>
<li>Select a Pokemon to learn Cut.</li>
<li>Confirm that the selected Pokemon is to learn Cut.</li>
<li>Choose a move for Cut to replace.</li>
</ol>


<p>The kicker? Pressing the B button or choosing the wrong option during <em>any</em> of these 7 steps takes the process back a step.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/1XSdWPY.jpg"></p>

<p>At this point in the stream, the audience hit 30,000 viewers. The increased activity caused an input delay of about 20 seconds from when the Twitch user input the command in chat to when the game recognized the command. This can make navigating menus difficult when an &ldquo;up&rdquo; or a &ldquo;down&rdquo; command is applied to a menu that isn&rsquo;t even visible yet.</p>

<p>Additionally, as the number of viewers in a stream increases, the number of trolls increases. And those trolls loved to spam the B button command.</p>

<p>Thanks to these two factors, the channel had failed to teach any Pokemon Cut for over <em>4 hours</em>. The stream chat became a bloodbath of blame.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/p30F3g7.png"></p>

<p>Eventually, it happened. The Farfetch&rsquo;d was taught Cut. No one knows <em>how</em>, but it happened. But <em>that</em> was only one step towards progress.</p>

<p>The second step is actually Cutting the tree. In order to Cut:</p>

<ol>
<li>Face the tree.</li>
<li>Bring up the Start menu.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Pokemon&rdquo;</li>
<li>Select the Pokemon with Cut.</li>
<li>Select Cut.</li>
</ol>


<p>Same kickers as before, too. Facing the tree is even harder since the same up/down commands for navigating the menus can reorient Red away from the tree.</p>

<p>It took another 4 hours to cut down that tree. Later, when Red was defeated in the Gym, the tree respawned. Yeah.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/NCo5N3j.png"></p>

<p>HM 01 was a harsh reminder that the more people present, the higher the chance that your task will fail. Not necessarily due to incompetence and disorganization, but due to mischief.</p>

<h1>Fighting The Ledge Boss</h1>

<p>After the Vermilion City Gym was (eventually) completed, the Twitch stream progressed through <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Route_9">Route 9</a> toward <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lavender_Town">Lavender Town</a>. Sounds simple, until Red hit this obstacle.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/ledge.png"></p>

<p>Red must walk from the left to the right through the 1-character-wide path. If Red went down, the ledge is a one-way drop, and Red must walk back to the beginning to try again.</p>

<p>The Twitch chat must go &ldquo;right&rdquo; about 8 times <em>without going &ldquo;down&rdquo; at all</em>.</p>

<p>HM01 had input lag as a contributing factor to its failures. In this case, the trolls had <em>all</em> the power. One &ldquo;down&rdquo; ends the entire attempt. And the stream was even more popular with an audience of 50,000 people.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/h2sFCtt.png"></p>

<p>The result? Crossing the ledge took over <em>12 hours</em>. And then Red was defeated by the trainer at the end of the ledge and so getting back across the ledge took an equally absurd amount of time.</p>

<p>Lesson learned? If trolls have absolute power, <em>they will use it</em> and they will use it without mercy.</p>

<p><em>EDIT 2/19: The defeat of the ledge boss was due to the intervention of another Twitch channel which <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/1y1ee8/the_meta_strat_or_how_we_beat_the_ledge/">executed a meta-strategy</a>: press &ldquo;right&rdquo; in sync with the input delay: with enough people, Red would move right enough times.</em></p>

<h1>Disregarding Decision Trees</h1>

<p>After the ledge incident, the fanbase became paranoid. What other gameplay aspects in this playthrough could be compromised by trolls in the future? One concern is the PC system used to store Pokemon; the same system can also <em>release</em> them, removing them from the game forever. The risk of losing a top Pokemon to the PC due to trolls was too great and would make the game nearly unwinnable, and therefore the stream decided to avoid using the PC unless necessary.</p>

<p>Red progressed through Lavender Town and arrived at <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Celadon_City">Celadon City</a>, where the Twitch channel defeated the Gym Leader for the fourth badge (it took awhile: there was a tree outside <em>and</em> inside the gym!)</p>

<p>At this point in Pokemon Red, the game becomes more nonlinear, which started a debate on what next to do in game. Many pointed out that the party lacked a Pokemon which could learn Surf, a skill, like Cut, which was required to progress in the game much later. Red will eventually earn such a Pokemon which could learn Surf (<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lapras">Lapras</a>) as a part of the plot, who&rsquo;s a decent combatant too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the player can also collect <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eevee">Eevee</a> as a free Pokemon. Eevee has three evolutions: the terrible <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Flareon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Flareon</a>, the good <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Jolteon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Jolteon</a>, and the great <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vaporeon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Vaporeon</a> who can also learn Surf. But in order to evolve Vaporeon Eevee into , the party must a) buy a Water Stone, and not accidentally any other elemental stone instead and b) use the Stone <em>without accidentally tossing it</em> and destroying it. Both of which are difficult due to input lag and trolls.</p>

<p>The party had 5 Pokemon (after a Rattata was deposited  earlier into the PC), and so the stream only had the opportunity for get <em>one</em> Pokemon, since the stream did not want deposit any in the PC for fear of release. Which is the more rational path for getting a Pokemon with Surf: waiting to get a guaranteed Lapras, or getting the Eevee and hope the stream can evolve it into a Vaporeon? A guaranteed decent Pokemon or a chance at a great Pokemon?</p>

<p>As it turns out, when 70,000 people make a decision, they aren&rsquo;t exactly rational. Instead, hilarity ensued.</p>

<h1>Game Over Theory</h1>

<p>The stream obtained the Eevee (even after many said it was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9cV06Yq.png">a bad idea</a>) and went to purchase a Water Stone. Due to input manipulation, they instead bought a Fire Stone, and later the Eevee evolved into the unhelpful Flareon. Chat becomes a bloodbath once again.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/QGiFYYu.jpg"></p>

<p>In order to make room for Lapras in the future, the stream attempted to use a PC to deposit Flareon.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/0ndYCF1.png"></p>

<p>Instead, both Abby and Jay Leno were permanently released.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/tumblr_n157ldJl611rvlenbo1_1280.jpg"></p>

<p>The stream became completely derailed.</p>

<p>As of today, Twitch pushes on, but everyone who&rsquo;s participating in the stream has now learned a lesson: people act in their self interest and do what they think is best. Trolls have&hellip;different self-interests. And there will always be trolls. Knowing how to fail gracefully is always valuable.</p>

<p>At the least, the amount of progress the stream has made is still very, very impressive and unexpected.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/the-filter-truth/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-10T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/the-filter-truth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> photos have filters applied to make them look more retro/cool. Instagram users are also able to apply tags to a photo to help categorize and promote them to the Instagram community. One such tag, #nofilter, is intended to emphasize such natural beauty that no filter is necessary to enhance the image. (or the photographer is just too lazy to decide on a filter)</p>

<p>But how many #nofilter images actually <em>have</em> no filter?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/instagram_selfie.gif"></p>

<p>As it turns not, not all of them.</p>

<p>After retrieving about 50,000 images through the Instagram API (code <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/get-data-from-photos-from-instagram-tags">available on GitHub</a>), here is the breakdown of filters on #nofilter-tagged Instagram images:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/nofilter.png"></p>

<p>Only 83% of #nofilter images have no filter?! You had one job, Instagram! :(</p>

<hr />

<p><em>The actual reason that this is happening is because Instagram rewards #tagspamming. More on that in a future blog post.</em></p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/moved-temporarily/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-06T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/moved-temporarily</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>. Image links without gimmicks. But recently, I noticed that whenever I clicked an Imgur link on Facebook or Twitter, it  navigated me to the main image page, with loads of blank empty space and links to other Imgur images instead of just showing me only the image. I double-check the URL, and it indeed begins with the &ldquo;i&rdquo; subdomain that indicates a direct link to the image, such as &ldquo;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/p9lG2ss.png">http://i.imgur.com/p9lG2ss.png</a>&rdquo;, so what&rsquo;s happening?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/imgur_direct.png"></p>

<p>As it turns out, when clicking a direct image link for the first time on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, Imgur will <strong>redirect</strong> you to the main image page instead. Try clicking the link in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=i.imgur.com&amp;src=typd">any i.imgur.com URL on Twitter</a>. The main image page has a &ldquo;follow us on Facebook/Twitter!&rdquo; button on desktops, or an advertisement on mobile devices.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/imgur_link.gif"></p>

<p>This behavior isn&rsquo;t particularly honest and upfront.</p>

<p>But is Imgur redirecting links from only these social media sites? Are these redirects an accident or are they deliberate?</p>

<p>A quick and dirty way to check is to use the command line. The <em>curl</em> command loads the data from a specified website. An optional parameter is <em>referrer</em>, which &ldquo;spoofs&rdquo; the URL of the website where the user is navigating from.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I wanted to &ldquo;access&rdquo; an image direct link coming from a website I know Imgur is not redirecting, such as Reddit. I run this command in the Windows Command Prompt or the Mac Terminal:</p>

<p><code>curl http://i.imgur.com/p9lG2ss.png --referer http://reddit.com -I</code></p>

<p>That gives me a Status Code 200, &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, meaning that the image was accessed successfully.</p>

<p><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: cloudflare-nginx
Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2014 01:41:40 GMT Content-Type: image/png [...]</code></p>

<p>Now what happens if the user accesses the link from Facebook or Twitter?</p>

<p><code>curl http://i.imgur.com/p9lG2ss.png --referer http://facebook.com -I</code></p>

<p>That returns something different.</p>

<p><code>HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Server: cloudflare-nginx
Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2014 01:44:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
[...]
Set-Cookie: __cfduid=dc2e0ae5ee57ff598e079d75fa628f0321391564643058; expires=Mon, 23-Dec-2019 23:50:00 GMT; path=/; domain=.imgur.com; HttpOnly
Location: http://imgur.com/p9lG2ss</code></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302">Status Code 302</a>, &ldquo;Moved Temporarily,&rdquo; is the error code for a redirect, and shows that Imgur implemented this behavior intentionally. It also provides the Location of the link to redirect to, in this case the default image page with Imgur&rsquo;s branding.</p>

<p>After checking all popular social media sites (and their respective URL shortners) as referrers against Imgur&rsquo;s direct image links, I determined that the only referrer domains that Imgur redirects are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://facebook.com">http://facebook.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://t.co">http://t.co</a></li>
<li><a href="http://plus.google.com">http://plus.google.com</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to share your cat photos and .gifs directly to friends, I guess you can still share them on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t say that what Imgur is doing is unethical; many startups use redirects to trap users and spam them with popups saying JOIN MY WEBSITE. At the least, your friends still get to see the image you linked. It&rsquo;s understandable why Imgur would use the redirects; direct image links cause them to lose money through bandwidth expense and earn none, while links to normal image pages make it apparent that the image is from Imgur, and the company could get new users from the branding. Many, many more direct links are made than indirect links, as shown in the image at the beginning of the article, and that can account for a lot of lost revenue.</p>

<p>The problem is that redirecting users without disclosure is the start of a slippery slope. When I post a direct image link by copying the &ldquo;Direct Link&rdquo; URL, I <em>expect</em> that others who use the link will also see the direct image. But that&rsquo;s not the case if the link is posted on Facebook or Twitter. Additionally, the redirects make the images take <em>much</em> longer to load on mobile, since loading the scripts and ads slow the entire page down. Making it so that the redirect is only seen the first time an image is viewed doesn&rsquo;t offer much solace.</p>

<p>If the redirects are successful at converting new users for Imgur, what&rsquo;s stopping them from redirecting other sites? I strongly hope that Imgur won&rsquo;t turn into the next Photobucket or Imageshack, but whenever a startup does something weird and not transparent, it&rsquo;s <em>never</em> a good sign.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A Thoughtful Analysis of the Most Poorly-Designed Chart Ever]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/01/more-language-more-problems/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-20T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/01/more-language-more-problems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I was surfing Reddit and came across an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1ur3ny/unnecessary_graph_of_most_desired_skills_in_2013/">interesting infographic</a> within the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/">ProgrammerHumor subreddit</a>. The infographic, as compiled by tech blog <a href="http://readwrite.com/">ReadWrite</a>, depicts the Top 10 Most In-Demand Developer Skills of 2013, as compiled by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> through keyword searches.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/infographic-1.jpg"></p>

<p>Take a look at the chart. What’s good and bad about it?</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>

<p>The data is properly cited.</p>

<h1>The Bad</h1>

<p><strong>EVERYTHING ELSE.</strong></p>

<p>What’s terrible about the graph? Let me count the ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using discrete values in the X-Axis for a continuous measurement (i.e. the percentage). And not only that, discrete values with two significant figures, which make the X-Axis unusually cluttered.</p></li>
<li><p>The Y-Axis is Language. This implies that some programming languages are more language than others.  (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152166149970450&amp;set=a.432190050449.225968.582270449&amp;type=1&amp;stream_ref=10">to be fair</a>, Java is more language than Android)</p></li>
<li><p>Not all entries on the chart are programming languages. (Android, for example, is an operating system.)</p></li>
<li><p>The 45-degree line in the chart implies that the relationship between language and %-of-searches is perfectly linear, where in reality the data has an upward-parabolic shape.</p></li>
<li><p>No relative proportions between the programming languages. We can&rsquo;t accurately see the increase in language Java has relative to Android just by looking at the graph.</p></li>
<li><p>Cannot easily associate a language with the given X-Axis value. The logos representing the programming language oscillate around the line, and it&rsquo;s hard to see at a glance which percentage corresponds to which language.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Fixing the Chart</h1>

<p>This isn’t one of those blog posts that make snarky criticism without offering any constructive input. (those will be posted next week). How can we make the chart somewhat logical?</p>

<p>The easiest way to improve the chart is to convert the chart from a line chart to a column chart. Here’s a column chart that keeps the intended impression of the original chart:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/dev-graph-1.png"></p>

<p>A much bigger improvement, although unfortunately without the cool hand-drawn logos. The axes are no longer illogical and it’s easy to determine the relative impact of each language (e.g. Java is clearly, clearly at the top). However, the large amount of text can clutter the bars, and it can be difficult to correlate the raw percentage with the scale at a glance.</p>

<p>Another option is to rotate the chart and use bars instead of columns:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/dev-graph-2.png"></p>

<p>This fixes the text issue by giving more room for text with most of the factors, but the Java text clips outside the chart. The correlation issue between language and percent value persists.</p>

<p>A best-of-both-worlds approach is to display the language on the Y-Axis and the raw percent value on the corresponding bar itself, allowing us to forgo the percent metric axis entirely.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/dev-graph-3.png"></p>

<p>There we go. Minimalist, fixes both the text and correlation issues, and gets the point across effectively.</p>

<p>All of these charts were created using R and ggplot2, and you can download the R code in <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/developer-graphs">this GitHub repository</a>. I wish the <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/01/08/in-demand-tech-skills-of-2013-java">orginal ReadWrite article</a> used a chart like the last one and…</p>

<p>Wait, they changed the infographic?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/infographic-2.jpg"></p>

<p>Hey, they fixed the chart, and it’s using a similar design as mine! What a crazy random happenstance!</p>

<p>The article was appended with an update:</p>

<blockquote><p>An earlier version of the infographic in this story presented the StackOverflow data in a confusing and conceptually problematic fashion. It has been updated.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Problematic&rdquo; is the world&rsquo;s biggest understatement.</p>

<p>Wait, what? How are these questions representative of &ldquo;a connected society,&rdquo; especially since I don&rsquo;t know any of the question authors?</p>

<p>Jelly tells its users that they can &ldquo;help friends, or friends-of-friends with their questions.&rdquo; The vast  majority of the questions I&rsquo;ve seen are from Friends of Friends. I&rsquo;m Facebook Friends with people who have <strong>thousands</strong> of friends; the probability that I have something in common with those second-degree friends is low.</p>

<p>Websites like Jelly and even Facebook are now utilizing the content made by second-degree &ldquo;friends.&rdquo; Why am I seeing pictures and statuses from friends of friends, who are essentially complete strangers?</p>

<h1>Facebook&rsquo;s Farcical Friends of Friends Folly</h1>

<p>A couple months ago, Facebook again tweaked the News Feed algorithm such that all new Posts on a friend&rsquo;s Wall are shown on your News Feed, even if the person making the Post is a complete stranger to you.</p>

<p>Originally, Facebook showed posts in your News Feed that were posted on a Friend&rsquo;s wall only if they were made by another Friend. If you are friends with both people, there&rsquo;s likely a common link between all three of you, such as going to the same college or working at the same company. That can make the Wall post more relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>However, people have many social circles. What happens when a stranger not in any of my social circles posts on a Friend&rsquo;s wall?</p>

<p>This post recently appeared in my News Feed:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fb-stranger-wall.jpg"></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know who the person with &ldquo;1 mutual friend&rdquo; is. (the &ldquo;1 mutual friend&rdquo; being the friend who received the post). I don&rsquo;t live in Arizona. Why am I seeing this?</p>

<p>Although I may be Facebook Friends with someone, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean I should be Friends with their Friends. Facebook is showing me Posts that aren&rsquo;t relevant to me at all.</p>

<p>This behavior also extends to your Friends&#8217; birthday: all &ldquo;Happy Birthday!&rdquo; posts on your Friend&rsquo;s Wall also display in your News Feed.</p>

<p>This entry was visible on my News Feed for an entire day:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/mutual-friends-birthday.jpg"></p>

<p>Facebook <strong>really</strong> wants you to wish your Friends happy birthday.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need to see strangers with &ldquo;1 mutual friend&rdquo; wish my friends Happy Birthday. It&rsquo;s just extra clutter on an already cluttered News Feed.</p>

<p>To be fair, other websites such as <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> push second-degree friends. Twitter&rsquo;s new <a href="https://twitter.com/i/discover">Discover</a> feature highlights users who the people you Follow are themselves Following. LinkedIn shows your connections&#8217; new connections so you can form connections with them too. But the difference between Twitter/LinkedIn and Facebook/Jelly is that both Facebook and Jelly push the power of <strong>intimate</strong> friendships, and imposing a sense of intimacy between strangers feels fake and intrudes on actual friendships.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/daily-reddit/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-18T07:30:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/daily-reddit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reddit has certainty received more attention in the mainstream media with its involvement in such events as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/business/media/bombings-trip-up-reddit-in-its-turn-in-spotlight.html?_r=0">Boston Marathon Bombings</a> and <a href="hhttp://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/">President Obama&rsquo;s AMA</a>. But has this publicity led to increase in overall activity on the site?</p>

<p>I analyzed the daily number of submissions from over two years, August 6th, 2011 to September 25, 2013 (41 million submissions total), to see which events, if any, have affected Reddit&rsquo;s growth rate. As it turns out, Reddit grows by itself.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/reddit_daily-mac.png"></p>

<p>Reddit&rsquo;s growth over the past two years has been almost entirely <strong>linear</strong>, with no notable acceleration in submission activity at any point in time.</p>

<p>Running a linear regression on daily number of submissions vs. number of days since the first date (8/6/11) reveals that the expected increase in number of submissions each successive day on average is <strong>66.48 submissions</strong>  (+1,948 submissions each successive month, +24,259 submissions each successive year)</p>

<p>This growth rate alone explains <strong>86.83%</strong> of the variation in number of submissions, indicating that external factors such as media publicity explain the remaining 13% of the variation.</p>

<p>From a business perspective, it&rsquo;s impressive that Reddit still continues to grow for being such a mature internet business, but prospective investors for a rumored <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/06/reddit-rumored-to-be-raising-money-at-a-400-million-valuation/">fundraising at a $400 Million valuation</a> might be weary that Reddit&rsquo;s growth is only linear, in contrast to the <strong>exponential</strong> growth of other startups such as Snapchat. (In fairness, submission activity may not necessarily correlate with revenue-driving content consumption activity)</p>

<p>A couple stray observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On January 18th, 2012, the daily number of Reddit submissions hit the minimum among the two-year period due to Reddit&rsquo;s participation in the Internet blackout in protest of SOPA. (Reddit&rsquo;s blackout was only from 8AM to 8PM EST, which is why there are a nonzero number of submissions for that day).</p></li>
<li><p>On April 1st, 2013, the daily number of Reddit submissions hit the maximum among the two-year period due to April Fool&rsquo;s Day, and the numerous amount of submissions for <em>X</em> brand/website&rsquo;s well-timed joke. However, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why there&rsquo;s a spike for April Fool&rsquo;s Day in 2013, but not April Fool&rsquo;s Day in 2012.</p></li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/subreddit-size/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-01T07:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/subreddit-size</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit&rsquo;s</a> subreddits cover, quite literally, an infinite amount of different topics. But which of its subreddits are the biggest?</p>

<p>Sure, Reddit is known for subreddits such as /r/pics and /r/aww, but in actuality, many of the lesser-known subreddits are much bigger than you think.</p>

<p>By tabulating the data of 37,561,369 total sitewide Link submissions, from 12/18/2011 to 9/26/2013, I created a tree map of the Top 100 subreddits by the number of Link submissions to that subreddit.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/subreddit-treemap.png" title="" ></p>

<p>In the tree map, the size of the rectangle and the saturation of the blue color indicate the relative size of the subreddit.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2013/07/new-default-subreddits-omgomgomg.html">default subreddits</a>, which all new users are subscribed to, are ranked mostly at the top. However, subreddits such as /r/POLITICO, /r/leagueoflegends, and /r/trees are higher (no pun intended) than most of the default subreddits.</p>

<p>And then you have the meta subreddits such as /r/ModerationLog and /r/reportthespammers, showing that people spend a considerable amount of time talking about Reddit itself.</p>

<p>Gaming has a very significant presence as well, with /r/Minecraft, /r/DotA2, and /r/tf2. (notably for the latter two, the trading subreddits for the respective games have significantly more link submissions than the subreddits themselves.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth nothing that these Top 100 subreddits only account for <strong>46.3% of all Reddit link submissions</strong>. Even the Top 500 subreddits only account for 66.2% of all Reddit submissions. The density of link submissions clearly follows a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long-tail</a> distribution, where most of the content is centralized from the top subreddits. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if Reddit is able to utilize that treasure trove of links in the future.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/10/wrds-and-vwls/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-14T07:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/10/wrds-and-vwls</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One reason startups use crazy and bizarre names like <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/12/totally-real-totally-serious/">NegaCycl</a> and <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/12/powerpoint-promo-party/">Filtrzzz</a> is to ensure that their name is unique, making it easier to acquire the .com domain name and Twitter handle for their startup. Another reason is to make their startup sound <em>kewl</em> and theoretically make the name more memorable in the minds of users and potential investors.</p>

<p>Dakwak, Wibki, Zeef, Funifi. These aren&rsquo;t random words: these are funded startups which were featured at <a href="http://startupalley.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Alley 2013</a>. And then you have startups such as Lyft, SCVNGR, and Fastly, which have all raised <em>tens of millions of dollars</em> in venture capital.</p>

<p>Do startups with these short, low-vowel names actually raise more money than startups with traditional names?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the association between the length of words in the English language and the number of vowels that they contain:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/english-words.png" width="600" height="600"></p>

<p>In the English language, the majority of the words have 8 letters, with 3 of those letters being vowels. (8,3) is also the center of the density distribution for the heat map, spreading outward.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the vowel distribution of normal English words to the distribution of the names of startups that have successfully raised venture capital, in order to identify just how many funded startups have quirky names:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/count-startups.png" width="600" height="600"></p>

<p>Wait, the two distributions are nearly identical! Both graphs are centered at about (8,3), radiating outward. This implies that the number of startups with uniquely-constructed names are outliers and not the typical names for startups.</p>

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t answer the core question: sure, fewer funded startups have weird names relative to the amount of total funded startups, but do they raise more money on average than startups with typical names?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/mean-startups-fund.png" width="600" height="600"></p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>There is no discernible pattern for the average amount raised, unlike with the previous two charts. For the vast majority of the possible combinations of name length and $ vowels, the range of capital raised is between $5M and $25M. There are higher values at the lower-end of the graph (low length, low vowels), but that can be attributed to the relatively low amount of startup data for those combinations to smooth out the average. (e.g. the $78M spike at 3 length, 2 vowels is due to the always-lovely <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/aol">AOL</a> and a <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2005/12/time-warners-aol-and-google-to-expand_20.html">$1 billion investment from Google</a>, and there are only 15 other startups in the segment.)</p>

<p>In fact, the statistical correlation between name length and funding, number of vowels and funding, and ratio of length to vowels and funding, are all effectively <strong>zero</strong>.</p>

<p>Sure, quirky startup names may make it easier to find a domain name, but it won&rsquo;t necessarily give an edge in the investment process.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[1 in 3 Links Submitted To Reddit Go To Imgur Or YouTube]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/09/reddit-imgur-youtube/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-29T10:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/09/reddit-imgur-youtube</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, you may have noticed that many link submissions go to &ldquo;imgur.com&rdquo;. <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>, an image hosting service that launched on Reddit a few years ago and has seen outstanding growth ever since, even <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/26/imgur-traffic-milestone-100m-uniques/">surpassing Reddit itself</a>.</p>

<p>But how many of Reddit&rsquo;s many, many links are actually links to Imgur? As it turns out, Imgur, along with YouTube, account for <em>32%</em> of the links submitted to Reddit.</p>

<p>Using Reddit&rsquo;s API, I have downloaded about 5 million link submissions from Reddit, accounting for nearly two months of activity from July 22nd to September 26th. I complied a list of the most-frequent link destination domains for the links submitted anywhere on Reddit. The results were interesting.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/links722_926.png"></p>

<p>The imgur domains (i.imgur.com and imgur.com) account for <strong>23.7%</strong> of all links submitted to Reddit, and the YouTube domains (youtube.com and youtu.be) account for <strong>8.2%</strong> of all links.</p>

<p>Two websites account for <strong>32%</strong> of all links submitted to Reddit (i.e. 1 in every 3 submitted links go to Imgur or YouTube), and no other website is remotely close. Not the meme sites, not the music sites, not the news sites, not the <em>porn</em> sites: Reddit is images and video.</p>

<p>But <em>where</em> on Reddit are the Imgur and YouTube links most prominent?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart of the top subreddits, by percentage of all  Imgur links submitted on Reddit:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/imgur722_926.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note how the <em>funny</em> subreddit has more Imgur links than the <em>pics</em> subreddit.</p>

<p>For YouTube, and the percentage of all YouTube links submitted on Reddit by subreddit:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/youtube722_926.png"></p>

<p><em>Videos</em> wins as you might expect, but <em>Music</em> is in second place. Along with <em>listentothis</em>,
<em>Metal</em>, and <em>hiphopheads</em>, YouTube is the de facto website for <em>music</em> as well as video. Gaming is also  very popular with YouTube links, with <em>gaming</em>, <em>leagueoflegends</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

<p>Images and video are the backbone of Reddit, and both Imgur and YouTube are the primary sources. Although, there appears to be a nontrivial demand for pure music websites such as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> and gaming video websites such as <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a> &hellip;could there be another big success story in the making?</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/alma-mater-data/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-20T10:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/alma-mater-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you read startup funding announcements on tech blogs frequently, you&rsquo;ve may have noticed that these startup founders have often attended prestigious universities. Founders who have graduated from Ivy League schools, such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton, unsurprisingly raise millions for their startups. Of course, top tier tech schools such as Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon foster a strong technical and entrepreneurial background: attributes which venture capitalists seek when investing in a startup founder. <em>(Disclosure: I&rsquo;m a Carnegie Mellon alumnus)</em></p>

<p>Do the tech universities produce more funded graduates than the Ivy League universities? Do the founders from Ivy League Universities receive more funding than those from the top tier tech universities?</p>

<p>Using TechCrunch&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase</a> API, I obtained the data of about 2,500 startup founders in the United States who have created a startup which has received investment from venture capitalists.</p>

<p>With that data, I found some rather interesting trends.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Which universities produced the most amount of graduates who have received funding?</h1>

<p>Thousands of university graduates attempt to make a startup, but most will not succeed. Are the graduates of some universities more frequently successful?</p>

<p>Here are the Top 16 universities with the most number of successfully-funded graduates:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/founder-colleges.png"></p>

<p>Stanford has the most amount of funded graduates, which is unsurprising as it&rsquo;s located in the Silicon Valley heart of venture capital.</p>

<p>Seven out of the eight Ivy League Universities (colored green on the chart) are present, but most of the Ivies are  in the middle of the chart. MIT and UC Berkeley each have nearly <em>double</em> the amount of successful graduates from Yale and Columbia.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Tel Aviv University, an Israeli university, ties Duke University at 21.</p>

<h1>Which university&rsquo;s graduates have cumulatively raised the most amount of total funding?</h1>

<p>Another way to measure success is through the success of the founders&#8217; subsequent startups and the amount of venture capital they have raised.</p>

<p>Here are the Top 8 universities whose graduates have received the most amount of funding:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sum-funding.png"></p>

<p>Harvard and Stanford graduates are very close in terms of total funding raised. However, there&rsquo;s a clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">Power Law</a> in effect, as those two along with UC Berkeley, have  produced founders who&rsquo;ve generated much, much more venture funding than those of the other universities.</p>

<h1>Which university&rsquo;s graduates raise the most amount of money in their first round of funding on average?</h1>

<p>Startup founders with big, world changing ideas need lots of venture capital. Only the founders with <em>good</em> ideas will actually receive it.</p>

<p>Here are the average amount of first-round funding for the top 16 universities with the most number of successfully-funded graduates:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/avg-first-raised.png"></p>

<p>Carnegie Mellon and Princeton, which had a relatively low number of funded founders and a relatively low number of total capital raised, instead have a <em>significantly</em> higher amount of average first funding. UCLA also placed. Perhaps the students from these three universities tend to have more ambitious startup ideas?</p>

<p>At first glance, Stanford and Harvard appear to be the kings of startups. They have the most amount of graduates, and the most amount of total venture capital raised. The tech blogs would surely consider that a success, but could the greater funding for CMU/Princeton lead to the creation of the next billion-dollar startup? We can only wait and see.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE: As pointed out by robotcookies on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6075862">corresponding Hacker News thread</a>, I missed UCLA in the first draft, which had 29 funded graduates. The charts have been updated.</em></p>

<p>You are welcome to use the founder data from CrunchBase by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjPFdCURhZvddEV1LUpaQUVsdmJYcERoM0FNU3lPcVE&amp;usp=sharing">viewing the data on Google Drive</a>, or by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jz2wsr4d6fc4t6/founders_w_college.csv">downloading the raw CSV</a>.</p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>University data was standardized to make analysis easier (e.g. for Carnegie Mellon, the founders who listed their institution as &ldquo;Carnegie Mellon University&rdquo;, &ldquo;Carnegie Mellon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;CMU,&rdquo; all had their institution changed to be &ldquo;CMU&rdquo;.)</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #1 measures unique founders, so it does not double-count a founder who has founded more than one  funded startup.</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #2 assumes equal contribution of each founder to the funding: if a startup has a total funding of $100,000 with 2 founders, the amount used for the chart will be $50,000 for each founder.</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #3 ignores startup data for the chart which has a Series B, Series C, or Series D listed as their first round on CrunchBase, or if the amount raised was not provided.</em></li>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/medium-normal/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-02T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/medium-normal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, a relatively new startup by Twitter cofounder Evan Williams, is a blog network that emphasizes simplicity and quality above everything else. Writers on the invite-only platform typically post stories about deeply personal topics, such as fighting adversity, never giving up your dreams, changing flawed systems, and other things that make the readers feel happy. One of my favorite articles on Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/editors-picks/57a0128b53c9">Choosing Minecraft Over Disney</a>, describe how a parent&rsquo;s children chose technology over television.</p>

<p>As of recently, the frequency of links to Medium posts on the popular tech-oriented link aggregator <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> has been increasing at an alarming rate. Since Medium&rsquo;s tales of triumph appeal to the ambitious entrepreneurs and startup founders of HN, the submissions are usually rapidly upvoted and easily make the front page, with  muted text helpfully noting that the link goes to medium.com. As a result, there has been <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968593">cognitive</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5974209">dissonance</a> on Hacker News whether Medium has too strong a presence on the aggregator, or worse,  potentially gaming the system.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://www.hnsearch.com/api">HNSearch API</a>, I analyzed the submissions of links under the medium.com domain to Hacker News to see just how Medium keeps surging in popularity. The results, as always, are very revealing.</p>

<p>The collected data is a sample of 1,000 links (out of 1,355 total) submitted to Hacker News under the medium.com domain.  Each data point contains the Title of the article, the HN user who submitted it, the amount of upvotes it received, the time it was posted (in PST), and links to both the article and the HN comments thread for reference. You can view the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjPFdCURhZvddDBPNFlMQUYyX1FhUkVVY2g1TmVLM1E&amp;usp=sharing">data on Google Drive</a>, or download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xnktwi9kheyqf6v/medium.csv">the raw CSV</a> and play with the data yourself.</p>

<p>What does the data tell us about Medium?</p>

<hr />

<h1>How quickly has medium.com grown in popularity in the past few months?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-month.png"></p>

<p>Medium was launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/medium-obvious/">in August 2012</a>, and received relatively little attention as evidenced by the graph. But 8 months later, the frequency of medium.com submissions hockey-sticked, receiving almost 5x growth from March 2013 to April 2013. That certainly explains one of the reasons why the rise in medium.com links is just being noticed now.</p>

<hr />

<h1>When are medium.com posts being written and submitted to HN?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-by-hour.png"></p>

<p>The time of day a blog post is submitted makes all the difference in the world, especially if your blog platform targets readers in a specific region. Medium links are frequently posted and submitted around 10am PST / 1pm EST, which is smart as it&rsquo;s relatively early in the day for those living in the United States, and your potential readers would be more likely to read your post, and HN users are more likely to upvote.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Who are the Hacker News users who most frequently submit medium.com articles?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-top-submitters.png"></p>

<p>Of the 1,000 submissions, there were only 622 unique submitters of medium.com links, each submitting an average of 1.61 posts. Most only post their own articles, but others, like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=rpsubhub">rpsubhub</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=mrbird">mrbird</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=nvk">nvk</a> submit Medium.com links more often. However, none of those users appear to be associated with Medium; they just submit links rather frequently.</p>

<hr />

<h1>What are the types of articles on medium.com submitted to Hacker News?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-wordcloud.png"></p>

<p>Medium&rsquo;s category system is somewhat obtuse, so I parsed the keywords from the titles of the submissions (using a method similar to <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/big-social-data/">my last post</a>) in order to get an idea what type of content is submitted most from Medium. There are lots of posts that ask rhetorical questions (<strong>What?</strong>, <strong>How?</strong>, <strong>Why?</strong>), and even more posts about the personal self with <strong>I</strong>. Not only is Medium using the right language to facilitate interaction, it&rsquo;s also hitting the interests of HNers with keywords such as <strong>Design</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h1>How successful <em>are</em> medium.com articles on Hacker News?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-front-page.png"></p>

<p>Out of the 1,000 submissions, only 158 had atleast 10 upvotes, which is enough to get the link to the front page, but not necessarily enough to keep it there. The graph is heavily right-skewed, with only 38 submissions getting above 100 points. It shows that medium.com links so not guarantee success, and even if you hit the front page, you have a low chance of hitting the coveted #1 ranking.</p>

<hr />

<p>Medium is definitely growing. HN is receiving more and more submissions which appeal to the average HN user, and posts are being submitted at all hours of the day. However, having a post at medium.com is not a panacea that will make your blog post be seen by thousands of people; you still need to write something interesting.</p>

<p>Time will tell. But if HN does indeed get bored of Medium, I believe the problem will correct itself.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Predicting the Number of Likes on a Facebook Status With Statistical Keyword Analysis]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/big-social-data/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-22T10:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/big-social-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What makes people click the Like button on Facebook Statuses? Does the status say something funny? Does it contain a cool link or a funny photo? Does the status actively engage its readers?</p>

<p>Needless to say, brands on Facebook want to know the answers to these questions. The more people that Like their statuses on their Facebook Pages, the more exposure they gain, and the more money they earn. Many, many companies have been created for the sole purpose of maximizing the number of Facebook Likes.</p>

<p>By 2013, most brands have realized that photo posts and statuses that ask a question <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/10/questions-equals-reponses/">will generate <em>much</em> higher numbers</a> of Likes. Personally, that&rsquo;s not why <em>I</em> like a given Facebook status: I Like statuses that contain new and exciting things that are relevant to my interests. The first thing I read in a status is the Message: if the message is boring and uninteresting, then there&rsquo;s no reason for me to Like the status needlessly.</p>

<p>Can the keywords and language in a Facebook Status predict the number of Likes the status receives?</p>

<p>Running multivariate regressions on keywords from thousands of Facebook statuses, I&rsquo;ve discovered that the language used in a status <em>does</em> help predict the number of Likes a status receives, and actually could help brands learn much more about their fans.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Setup</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/rdataset.png"></p>

<p>In order to draw accurate conclusions from the analysis, large amounts of data are needed (and there&rsquo;s no such thing as too much data).</p>

<p>I decided to analyze the Facebook Pages of 3 extremely popular News sources: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cnn">CNN</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytimes">New York Times</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcworldnews">BBC World News</a>. All three Pages have millions of fans, post the same types of Facebook statuses, and post statuses extremely frequently to Facebook (around 8-9 times a day). The statuses analyzed will be from June 1st 2012 to June 1st 2013, in order to both gather a large sample size (~3,000  statuses from each Page) and a ensure a consistent apples-to-apples comparison between the three sources.</p>

<p>The raw data, code, and a detailed technical explanation of the statistical techniques used to process the data can be found in <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-keyword-regression-analysis">this GitHub repository</a>. (tl;dr, it&rsquo;s an optimized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least squares</a> regression)</p>

<p><em>Can the keywords and language in a Facebook Status predict the number of Likes the status receives?</em> We&rsquo;re ready to test this hypothesis.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<ul>
<li>The most impactful keywords for CNN are political keywords.</li>
<li><strong>NEWS</strong> (&ldquo;BREAKING NEWS&rdquo;) predicts more Likes than <strong>Photo</strong> (i.e. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/5550296508/posts/10151626042186509">Travel Photo of the Day</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Bourdain</strong> refers to Anthony Bourdain, who very recently began <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain:_Parts_Unknown">a food and travel show</a> on CNN. I assume that targets CNN&rsquo;s primary demographic.</li>
<li>The presence of <strong>Barack</strong> (Barack Obama) predicts more likes than just <strong>Obama</strong>.</li>
<li>The presence of <strong>Monday</strong> predicts more likes most other keywords. Garfield would be disappointed.</li>
<li>The presence of <strong>North</strong> (North Korea) predicts a <em>decrease</em> in Likes from the average. Is North Korea boring?</li>
<li>The presence of <strong>Check</strong> (&ldquo;Check this out!&rdquo;) also predicts a decrease in Likes from the average. This is interesting because this call-to-action is usually associated with the other keywords. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not necessary?</li>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<ul>
<li>The most impactful keywords for BBC World News are keywords describing news around the world. Unlike CNN and NYTimes, there are very few impactful keywords related to domestic politics (such as Prime Minister <strong>David</strong> Cameron, and even <strong>Barack</strong> is more impactful than him.)</li>
<li><strong>Malala</strong> refers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai">Malala Youdsfzai</a>, a Pakistani activist who survived an assassination attempt.</li>
<li>Implicit question keywords such as <strong>Let</strong>, <strong>Do</strong>, and <strong>Would</strong> are all very effective.</li>
<li>The simple salutation of <strong>Hi</strong> predicts a decrease in Likes. There&rsquo;s a British joke here somewhere.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>The language used in Facebook Statuses can be very useful in identifying what words Fans like, and what words will be most useful in generating the most exposure. While my analysis can&rsquo;t predict the <em>exact</em> number of Likes a Status receives, and I likely <a href="http://xkcd.com/882/">broke a few rules of statistics</a> in the process of making this post, the impact of language and specific keywords on social media interaction is an endeavor worth pursuing.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook Hashtags Are Fundamentally Broken]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/hashtag-hashtag/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-14T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/hashtag-hashtag</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> added <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/633/Public-Conversations-on-Facebook">searchable hashtags</a> to all status updates and user comments. As with <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, whenever a Facebook user posts an status with a #hashtag, that hashtag becomes clickable and leads to a News Feed of all other publically-visible posts with that hashtag.</p>

<p>The implementation of hashtags in Facebook is an obvious move. Advertisements and television shows display hashtags all the time to encourage users to Tweet about them: it&rsquo;s free marketing, after all. Facebook can piggy-back off those already-existing hashtags and grow user adoption <em>very</em> quickly, especially with Facebook-owned <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> already supporting hashtags.</p>

<p>However, Facebook is a fundamentally different social network than Twitter. While Twitter uses hashtags to quickly categorize a feed of 140-character thoughts, Facebook&rsquo;s content feeds  typically consist of long posts and large images. Additionally, while posts on Twitter are explicitly public or private, Facebook&rsquo;s privacy settings are more granular: if users don&rsquo;t make their posts Public, the hashtag is essentially useless. And the brands are going to <em>love</em> hashtags. Maybe too much.</p>

<p>The magic of Facebook is flat-out incompatible with the magic of hashtags.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Too Long; Didn&rsquo;t Read</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/facebooktwitter.png"></p>

<p>Since Twitter posts have a length limit, they&rsquo;re short and occupy a consistent amount of space on the webpage. Facebook posts can be near-unlimited length, utilize a large amount of a white space between posts, and also potentially contain an equally-long comment section. As a result, 5 Twitter posts can use the same amount of screen real-estate as 2 Facebook posts. Given the already incredibly low signal-to-noise quality ratio of #hashtag feeds (as evident above), this makes reading hashtag feeds on Facebook a chore.</p>

<h2>A Thousand Words Takes A Lot Of Space</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/bieber-twitter.png"></p>

<p>Facebook displays pictures embedded in posts natively in the feed, while Twitter requires the user to click the Tweet to see the photo. In this case, the ratio of Twitter:Facebook posts can be even worse, in this case 6 Twitter posts for 1 Facebook post.</p>

<h2>If A Hashtag Isn&rsquo;t Seen, Was It Posted?</h2>

<p>Twitter is opt-in private posting. Facebook is opt-<em>out</em> private posting. That&rsquo;s a big usability problem.</p>

<p>The Facebook hashtag feeds only show posts that are explicitly  made Public (or posts from your Friends which are set to a privacy of Friends Only). If the user is unaware that their posts are not Public by default, then their posts containing the hashtag will never be seen and the user won&rsquo;t be able to participate in social hashtag feeds.  Although Facebook has made improvements in helping users set the intended privacy level of a post, it makes the process of posting much more deliberate and much less impulsive than Twitter.</p>

<h2>#brand #branding #marketing #yolo #swag</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hashtagabuse.png"></p>

<p>Brands love hashtags. The more hashtags included in a Tweet, the more exposure the Tweet receives, right?</p>

<p>With Twitter, there&rsquo;s a limit on the number of hashtags in a Tweet due to the delicate balance between the number of hashtags, the length of the hashtags, and the length of the Tweet itself. On Facebook, you can include <strong>25</strong> hashtags in any post!</p>

<p>Since there&rsquo;s no consequence for abusing hashtags, expect to see more Facebook brands taking advantage this new free source of marketing. Expect to see Facebook get much more cluttered.</p>

<h2>Explicit Image Bombing</h2>

<p>A malicious user could theoretically insert shock images into popular hashtag feeds. During my testing of Facebook hashtags, there was a surprising amount of nudity in the seemingly-innocuous #many hashtag.</p>

<p>On Twitter, the volume of Tweets is much higher and the images are hidden by default, so the odds of such an attack working on Facebook are much higher than on Twitter.</p>

<h2>Comment Hashtags Different From Post Hashtags</h2>

<p>You can hashtag comments on Facebook posts like you can hashtag Facebook posts themselves. But hashtagged comments won&rsquo;t appear in the hashtag News Feed. Whereas on Twitter, Replies are also Tweets and can be hashtagged accordingly. This behavior isn&rsquo;t surprising, but it&rsquo;s still a big inconsistency.</p>

<hr />

<p>Will Facebook Hashtags fail due to the massive differences between Facebook and Twitter? It&rsquo;s hard to say, but I&rsquo;m skeptical that Facebook will be able to capture the hashtag magic.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many legitimate reasons for users to uninstall programs on their computer, such as freeing hard-disk space and lowering CPU overhead. A decade ago, when excessive hard-drive space was a luxury, avid PC gamers would frequently uninstall large, multi-gigabyte games that they were no longer playing in order to make space for new games.</p>

<p>Obviously, developers would prefer that their users not uninstall the software that they spent years creating.  Regardless, developers should ensure that the uninstall process works properly.</p>

<p>Otherwise, a poorly coded PC game uninstaller could delete not just the game, but the <em>entire hard drive</em>. That would be a problem.</p>

<p><span class="pull-right" style="padding: 20px"><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/1999/01/06"><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/pennyarcademyth2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>

<p>In late 1998, Bungie (which would later create the <a href="http://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/">Halo</a> series) released <a href="http://mythipedia.wikia.com/wiki/Myth_II:_Soulblighter">Myth II: Soulblighter</a> for Windows. Myth II, a real-time tactics game, was received with great reception and highly-positive reviews.</p>

<p>But before the worldwide release, a Bungie employee <a href="http://halo.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=juggernougat">uninstalled version 1.0</a> of Myth II, and afterwards, her PC refused to reboot:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was discovered by a very nice young lady in a Japanese office as she worked on the Asian versions of Myth – just as she was trying out the final build. She attempted to uninstall it from the main root folder of her hard drive – not brilliant, but pretty common practice – and perfectly fine for most games. The game proceeded to eat her hard drive like a fresh Bento Box.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Myth II Uninstaller worked by deleting the folder which contained the game files. However, this implementation assumed that the user installed Myth II in the default directory. (i.e. C:\Program Files\Myth II). If the user installed Myth II in a <em>different</em> directory, such as the <em>system root C:\</em>, then when the user uninstalled the game, <strong>all the files in the C drive were deleted.</strong> Boom.</p>

<p>As Bungie later explained <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/news/98/december/981229/bungierecall.html">in a press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In certain unusual cases, using the Uninstaller can cause problems. If a user chooses an installation directory other than the default directory, they should NOT use the Uninstaller but should manually drag the Myth II folder into the Recycle bin and delete it.</p>

<p>Anyone who has the game but has not yet installed it is asked to wait for a new version of the Installer which we will release shortly. If you have already installed the game, there is no harm in playing it, but players should be careful not to use the Uninstall executable. If you have already Uninstalled and not experienced obvious problems, there is nothing to worry about.</p></blockquote>

<p>Calling the potential obliteration of an operating system a &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is an understatement.</p>

<p>Although the issue was not widespread, Bungie decided to do a recall of all Myth II CDs and redistribute a version 1.1, eliminating most of the game&rsquo;s profits in the process.</p>

<p>You could say that the Myth II version 1.0 uninstaller worked exactly as intended: it did indeed uninstall the game. It just worked <em>too</em> well.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/05/deep-breaths-more/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-30T23:23:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/05/deep-breaths-more</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="pull-right" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/globecto.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/">Guild Wars 2</a> is an incredible massively-multiplayer online role-playing game. The goal of Guild Wars 2, developed by ArenaNet, is to save the world, complete quests, and get awesome loot; objectives similar to that of many other MMORPGs such as <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">World of Warcraft</a>. However, Guild Wars 2 differentiates itself from its spiritual predecessors with its dynamically-changing world, incredible graphics, and the elimination of annoying and tedious time-wasters that have plagued the MMORPG genre.</p>

<p>The best items in Guild Wars 2, naturally, require a large amount of effort and money to obtain. In order to create Legendary weapons, players must obtain large amounts of an item known as Globs of Ectoplasm. Globs of Ectoplasm (abbreviated as &ldquo;Ecto&rdquo;) are obtained randomly when a player salvages a Rare item using a Salvage Kit. Due to their high demand, Ecto effectively serve as a second currency in Guild Wars 2.</p>

<p>Using the best Salvage Kit (that doesn&rsquo;t require paying real-world money), players received, on average, 0.9 Ecto per Rare Item Salvage, a value that has been well-documented and well-tested. But after a patch released a couple days ago, <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/first">players on the Official Guild Wars 2 forums</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1fc540/ecto_salvage_rate_bug_being_looked_into_keep_your/">Reddit</a> began to notice that the drop rate for Ecto was <em>much</em> lower, with no mention in the patch notes.</p>

<p>How do you <em>prove</em> something that occurs at random now occurs less frequently?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>What is &ldquo;Random&rdquo;?</h1>

<p>The first rule of any official MMO forum: never accuse the developers of making implicit changes to the game unless you have proof. Such tactics are commonly employed by forum trolls and it makes building a community more difficult.</p>

<p>The second rule of any official MMO forum: never accuse the developers of manipulating probability. As with normal gambling, players can hit a streak of bad luck with loot drops, enemy critical attacks, etc. But the anecdotal data from one player is not sufficient proof of any probability change. (an <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Why_does_Onyxia_cast_Deep_Breath%3F">old meme</a> from the World of Warcraft era mocked the userbase&rsquo;s inability to comprehend the definition of random)</p>

<p>On May 28th, a player <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/first">noted on the official GW2 forums</a> that out of 166 salvages, he only received about 80 Ecto, or about 0.5 Ecto/Salvage. This is approximately <em>half</em> of the original rate of 0.9 Ecto/Salvage. Since the rate of new Ecto entering the market was halved with no change in demand, the Auction House <a href="http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/19721">price for Ecto</a> began to steadily rise.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/gw2ecto.png"></p>

<p>The price increase in the short-term was not <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/05/stones-of-jordan/">economy-breaking</a>, but when you need 250 Ectos to create a Legendary weapon in the long-term, it can add up very quickly.</p>

<p>Other players provided their experiences in the thread, with limited results such as &ldquo;noticed this too, yesterday i salvaged 9 rares, got 4 ectos&rdquo; and &ldquo;20 rare at the end of my day, i save them before go bed: 0 ecto. wtf?&rdquo;. Such sample sizes are much too low to satisfy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a> and draw any remotely accurate conclusions.</p>

<p>Regina Buenaobra, ArenaNet Community Manager, eventually <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/page/3#post2115818">responded</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Changes to important things like salvage rates would be listed in the update notes if they have changed. If it’s not in the update notes, then no changes have been made by the development team.</p></blockquote>

<p>So Word of God implies that everyone is wrong. Issue over?</p>

<p>Of course not!</p>

<h1>No Such Thing As Too Much Data</h1>

<p>Despite Regina&rsquo;s dismissal, players continued to post in the thread and began quoting even larger sample sizes, such as a <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/2114853">salvaging 500 Rares</a> resulting in 286 Ectos (0.57 Ecto/Salvage) and <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/page/3#post2116461">salvaging 775 Rares</a> resulting in 402 Ecto (0.52 Ecto/Salvage). With those sample sizes, the probability that the true salvage rate is unchanged from 0.9 Ecto/Salvage is essentially zero.</p>

<p>John Smith, ArenaNet&rsquo;s resident economist, <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/page/4#post2116752">replied</a> that he&rsquo;ll &ldquo;look into this and get back to you.&rdquo; A day later, John made a <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/2122262">promise</a> that &ldquo;if we change anything involving ectos, there will be public information on it.&rdquo; Sure enough, on May 30th, a new patch was released with only <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/info/news/Game-Update-Notes-May-28-2013/2124609">one patch note</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fixed a salvaging bug introduced in the last patch that sometimes caused salvage kits to yield incorrect results.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that was that, the price of Ecto almost immediately dropped. All was well.</p>

<p>John left one final <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/2124684">message</a>: &ldquo;Thanks to everyone for your help identifying the issue and providing great data for me to start with in my research.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="pull-right" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/GoldenSun.png"></p>

<p>When the Game Boy Advance was released in June 2001, Nintendo promised that the handheld device would be capable of delivering a home gaming console experience on-the-go. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun">Golden Sun</a>, developed by Camelot and published by Nintendo a few months after the console&rsquo;s release, exemplified the GBA&rsquo;s full capabilities with its hand-drawn environments, flashy battle effects, and <em>very</em> difficult dungeon puzzles which undoubtedly resulted in the sale of many strategy guides.</p>

<p>In Golden Sun, you play as a group of teenage mages called Adepts, who wield the power of the four elements (Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water) by casting spells with Psynergy. The antagonists of the game are a pair of jerks who are attempting to reawaken a dangerous and sealed power, and only four kids can stop them from destroying the world. Released two years later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun:_The_Lost_Age">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a> takes place immediately after the conclusion of the first game with a different quartet of Adepts and a new pair of jerks. In this sequel, it is revealed that the jerks who keep trying to kill you are not the bad guys and the whole conflict is just one big misunderstanding! Yes, the plot is very reminiscent of other Japanese-developed RPGs such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_(video_game)">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, but it&rsquo;s still impressive for a game I typically played in the backseat of a car.</p>

<p>Like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger, Golden Sun has an inventory system where players earn new weapons and items by purchasing them at a store or by finding them as loot from defeating enemies in the world. The most powerful weapons, naturally, only drop from enemies at the end of the game with odds of less than 0.01% per kill. If you killed <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binomial+distribution%28100%2C1%2F256%29">such enemies 100 times</a>, for example, you would only have a 32% expected chance of seeing a rare drop among all the kills. And killing that many enemies could take hours. It depends on the almighty will of Golden Sun&rsquo;s Random Number Generator.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Random_Number_Generator">Golden Sun RNG</a> is so poorly implemented that players have found out how to make events with 1/256 probability occur <em>one hundred percent</em> of the time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>You Make Your Own Luck</h1>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/221/"><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/random_number.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Soon after the first Golden Sun was released, players discovered that the first random enemy encounter the player enters after turning the GBA on was always a First Strike, where the player&rsquo;s party gets a free turn. Was this a cute gameplay mechanic intended to give the player a quick advantage, or was it indicative of a flaw in the game&rsquo;s RNG?</p>

<p>Most modern RNGs are partially seeded and randomized using a timer, i.e. the current time of the computer in microseconds. This makes it infeasable to reproduce the output of the RNG reliably.</p>

<p>However, the GBA does not have an internal clock, so time-based methods of seeding aren&rsquo;t possible. By the time the sequel was released in 2003, the
<a href="http://www.goldensunrealm.com/gs/nickpresta_rng-guide.txt">entire Golden Sun RNG</a> was reverse-engineered:</p>

<blockquote><p>Golden Sun uses the ANSI-C standard rand function as its Pseudo-Random Number
Generator.</p>

<p>There is one difference: Golden Sun&rsquo;s RNG uses an unsigned 4-byte number and
returns it with no shifting, so you&rsquo;d replace &ldquo;return ((next >>16) &amp; 32757);&rdquo;
with &ldquo;return (next &amp; 4294967295);&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, ordinarily, is a perfectly capable RNG, but there is one flaw with what
Golden Sun does with it.</p>

<p>It only makes a new random number when something random happens. What&rsquo;s more,
it uses <em>two</em> copies of the RNG to create two random numbers, and the
first RNG only handles battle situations.</p>

<p>As such, it is easy to control when a new random number is generated.</p>

<p>On top of this, the RNGs are seeded with 0 when the GBA is reset, and because
of the way the game has been programmed, the RNG controlling battle events will
<em>continue</em> to be 0 even when you load the game&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Golden Sun&rsquo;s Random Number Generator isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;random&rdquo; at all. It&rsquo;s manipulated <em>entirely</em> from player-controlled actions, from the moment the Game Boy Advance is turned on.</p>

<h1>Get Lucky</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/kiku.png"></p>

<p>One of Golden Sun&rsquo;s contributions to the typical RPG character class customization is the <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Djinn">Djinn system</a>. In the game lore, Djinn are impish creatures that grant enhanced powers to Adepts. There are four types of Djinn, one for each element, that can be found in the overworld, and each Djinni can be used to either increase a character&rsquo;s statistics, or Unleashed to provide a powerful spell effect. Also, as with many other RPGs, Golden Sun implements an elemental rock-paper-scissors combat system: enemies are weak to an element and resistant to another.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">GameFAQs</a> forum user by the name of &ldquo;darkpanther&rdquo; discovered that using a Djinn Unleash with an element that is the enemy&rsquo;s weakness will not only increase the amount of Experience and Coins earned, but also <em>quadruple</em> the chance of the enemy dropping a rare item. (this fact is neither hinted anywhere in the game nor stated in any strategy guides)</p>

<p>This is essential toward manipulating the RNG. Normally, the rarest items such as <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Tisiphone_Edge">Tisiphone Edge</a> and <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Lachesis%27_Rule">Lachesis&#8217; Rule</a> have an &ldquo;Item-Class Chance&rdquo; of 9, meaning the item has a 1/(2<sup>9-1</sup>) = 1/256 chance of dropping per enemy kill. The &ldquo;DP Method&rdquo; decreases the ICC by 2, meaning the new drop rate becomes 1/(2<sup>7-1</sup>) = 1/64. But:</p>

<blockquote><p>As &lsquo;unpredictable&rsquo; as RNGs seem to be, if they are always seeded to the same
value and do not use a timer-based response, they will become predictable by
anyone who is good at noticing patterns. One pattern being, for example, that
the 31st random number that is calculated &ndash; 33727075 &ndash; will drop <em>any</em> item if
the enemy dying when this random number was called was just killed by an
elemental Djinn attack that it is weak to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Calculating the 31st random number would fail against an ICC9 item, but now works against an ICC7 item. (and all items of lower ICC too)</p>

<p>Therefore, <strong>in order to guarantee that an item drops, kill the appropriate enemy with an element-advantage Djinni such that the 30th random number is generated</strong>. (the 31st random number is generated on the enemy&rsquo;s death)</p>

<p>How do you ensure that you only create 31 random numbers? From the Golden Sun Wikia:</p>

<blockquote><p>Save the game and do a hard reset in the area where the monster that drops the item you need appears. Run around to get in a battle. If the encounter consists of a formation of 2 monsters, with at least one of them being the monster you want, proceed. If not, do another hard reset and try again.</p>

<p>During battle, have the entire party use multi-targetting Psynergy on the targets in the first turn, and since a battle right after a hard reset always involve your party attacking first where possible, the monsters will not be able to act. During the second turn, use two multi-targetting Psynergy on the enemies, and have the third party member (or fourth, if one of the three party members that act before uses Defend) unleash an attack Djinni of the element the monster is weak to on the monster. If by this point, the monster flashes in colour and dies, you will obtain the drop of that monster at the end of the battle, however rare it is. If the monster does not die then (either dies too soon or doesn&rsquo;t die by this step), adjust the power of your attacks until you get it just right.</p></blockquote>

<p>Moral of story: if you&rsquo;re making a video game, seed your RNGs with an algorithm that players can&rsquo;t manipulate 100%. Otherwise, hilarity will inevitably ensue. I forgive Camelot for implementing a simplistic RNG though; the two games&#8217; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaxYYwMqiso&amp;list=PL8C84ECF55B28DC74">awesome</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M31afGXIGpQ&amp;list=PL586792F46D5A35D4&amp;index=13">soundtrack </a> more than makes up for it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="pull-right" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/metroidboxart.jpg"></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of video games, you&rsquo;ve likely heard of the Metroid franchise. Released for the NES in 1986 by Nintendo, Metroid set a new standard for 2-D exploration in video games with its expansive power-up system, well-hidden secrets, and polished platforming controls. Due to its popularity, Metroid has been rereleased multiple times: as an unlockable in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Prime">Metroid Prime</a>, an unlockable in the remake <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Zero_Mission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_NES_Series">standalone game</a> on the Game Boy Advance, the Wii Virtual Console, and the 3DS Virtual Console.</p>

<p>You play as Samus Aran, an armored bounty hunter who has infiltrated the base of the dreaded Space Pirates on Planet Zebes. Samus must defeat the leaders of the Space Pirates: the dinosaur Kraid, the dragon and memetic badass of the series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_(Metroid)">Ridley</a>, and the AI construct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Brain_(Metroid)">Mother Brain</a>. Additionally, Samus must find a way to defeat the Metroids, which are nearly-indestructible parasites that threaten all life. Yes, this was a plot written in the 80&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Since the NES Metroid cartridge did not have the ability to save games, and the game itself took awhile to complete, Nintendo developed a password system to allow players to continue at a later time. Upon death, the player received a 24-character alphanumeric password that could be entered to restore all items the player has unlocked and remember which bosses the player has defeated. Most of these passwords were gibberish that required a pen-and-paper to write down and remember.</p>

<p>One password, however, is more memorable, and much more sinister.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>The Password is Always Swordfish</h1>

<p>Even before the days of the internet and personal computing, players <a href="http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Metroid_passwords">found passwords</a> with unique properties.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Narpas_Sword">Narpas Sword password</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/narpassword.png"></p>

<p>is essentially the debug mode for the game, with all items unlocked, infinite health, and infinite health for Samus.</p>

<p>Another, more revealing password is the <a href="http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Justin_Bailey">Justin Bailey password</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/justinbailey.png"></p>

<p>This password starts the game with most unlockables obtained, but more notably, it changes Samus&rsquo;s sprite from an armored powersuit to a bikini swimsuit.</p>

<p>One password, discovered over 20 years later, long after the Metroid password system had been completely reverse-engineered, does not grant you all items. <em>This</em> password just crashes and resets the game:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/engageridley.png"></p>

<h1>WTF?</h1>

<p>On a NES and various other rereleases, inputting that code will cause the game to either simply reset or transform the game into a glitched wonderland:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/x3UyVylP7AI "></iframe></div>


<p>But what happens when you enter the password on an emulated Virtual Console, where the game environment is sandboxed? In the case of the 3DS Virtual Console, the <em>3DS completely crashes</em>:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pjQ7SjB_6a8 "></iframe></div>


<h1>Rated E for Everyone?</h1>

<p>You may be asking &ldquo;did someone at Nintendo actually program a consequence for profanity in the game? Is the glitching and crashing a punishment for the perverse player?&rdquo; In truth, the password is merely a coincidence.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the password algorithm for Metroid has been reverse-engineered, and you can actually download a program to both generate and interpret such passwords <a href="http://games.technoplaza.net/mpg/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/metroidpassgen.png"></p>

<p>The profane password is indeed a legitimate password (in which Ridley is already defeated, ironically enough). But why does it crash the game? The <a href="http://games.technoplaza.net/mpg/password.txt">Metroid Password Format Guide</a> explains the secret:</p>

<blockquote><p> There are five valid start locations. They are specified using bits 64-66.
  To start in Brinstar, all the bits should be off. Norfair, Kraid&rsquo;s Lair, and
  Ridley&rsquo;s Lair can be specified by turning their bit on and leaving the others
  off. Tourian is specified by turning on Norfair and Kraid&rsquo;s Lair
  simultaneously. Any other combination of these three bits is invalid and will
  cause Metroid to reset.</p>

<p>  The reset bit is part of the start location. There are 16 possible values,
  but only 5 valid ones. Turning on the reset bit will produce and invalid
  start location and cause Metroid to reset. This is why it is called it is
  called the reset bit, because it guarantees an invalid password.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the profane password, the reset bit is turned on, so it will always cause a reset. And that&rsquo;s why the weird behavior happens.</p>

<p>If you manually disable the reset bit using this tool in order to make the password valid, the new password becomes:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/metroidpassgen2.png"></p>

<p>Not as catchy, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In fact, the Justin Bailey password is also a completely coincidental password. Sometimes, passwords can just do very unexpected things.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-13T18:51:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/05/overly-attached-startup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago, my best friend wanted to make a personal website. After talking with her about what types of features she wanted (home page, photo galleries, low price, etc.) I recommended that she use a website-building platform with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor, such as <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> or <a href="http://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a>. I had heard good things about both websites, especially Weebly, a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/01/15/weebly-goes-with-ycombinator/">Y Combinator startup</a> which has been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/03/with-over-15m-sites-built-weebly-launches-new-planner-and-mobile-editor-brings-website-creation-service-to-android/">rolling out new features</a> and receiving positive reviews.</p>

<p>She registered for Weebly and loved it. I registered as well to check it out, and I was also impressed after creating a draft test website and experimenting with both drag-and-drop UI elements and raw HTML/CSS editing. Since Weebly has Contributor functionality, I was able to edit her website without having to access her account. I made a few CSS tweaks and that was it: I didn&rsquo;t publish my own website on Weebly, as I&rsquo;m very happy with this blog. :)</p>

<p>A day after her website was published, I received an e-mail from Weebly: a generic &ldquo;First Steps to Creating Your Website.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just one email, I think, so I ignore it. And then, the next day, I receive another e-mail that was much less subtle: &ldquo;Your website misses you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is certainly the first time a startup&rsquo;s emails have tried to <em>guilt</em> me into using the service.</p>

<h1>An Email A Day Keeps The Users Away</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/weebly1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When I register for <em>any</em> business, not just including startups, I don&rsquo;t enjoy seeing any emails that aren&rsquo;t helpful or aren&rsquo;t expected. I&rsquo;m OK when businesses send emails that alert me when a new service has been launched or when a scheduled newsletter is released. In the former case, the email is directly relevant to my interests, in the latter case, the email is not an unexpected surprise.</p>

<p>In Weebly&rsquo;s case, and any other startup that resorts to forward emailing strategies as a form of &ldquo;growth hacking,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re invalidating my trust. A once-a-month announcement about your business is OK, but if I want to visit your website, I don&rsquo;t need to be reminded every <em>day</em>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the emails that Weebly has sent:</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 5th: First Steps to Creating Your Website</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/weebly2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is actually a good first e-mail.</p>

<p>It adds a personal touch. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it since I didn&rsquo;t plan on publishing my own website, but to a new customer, it makes them feel welcome.</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 6th: Your website misses you!</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/weebly3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I received this <em>the next day</em> after the previous email. My website misses me? It&rsquo;s been two days! Which you tell me with a rather disturbing amount of precision!</p>

<p>My website is not a cow in FarmVille. I don&rsquo;t need to publish my website immediately. In fact, if I were to publish a website, I would make sure it&rsquo;s polished first, in which case the email&rsquo;s push toward publishing ASAP would actually be insulting.</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 7th: Need Any Help?</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a totally-not-automatically-generated e-mail by a employee at Weebly. It lacks any Weebly branding, which supposedly gives it a more &ldquo;personal&rdquo; touch&hellip;except if Richard wanted to give it a personal touch, he would have included <em>my name</em>. The <a href="http://emailmarketing.comm100.com/email-marketing-ebook/can-spam-law.aspx">legally-mandated</a> unsubscribe link, a requirement for commercial emails, doesn&rsquo;t make me feel any more comfortable.</p>

<p>And again, it&rsquo;s only been three days.</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 8th: Max, check out your mobile website!</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/weebly5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While that feature may be cool, finding an <em>excuse</em> to send me an e-mail really isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>

<p>Weebly skipped May 9th, fortunately.</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 10th: Free vs. Pro: Which One is Right for You?</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/weebly6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>&ldquo;As you may have noticed.&rdquo; In that case, why bother sending the e-mail? Will the e-mail&rsquo;s argument be any different?</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 11th: Max, get 33% off at Weebly!</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/weebly7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re mixing both overly precise user registration dates <em>and</em> &ldquo;as you may have noticed&rdquo; verbage! I did notice, as a matter of fact! I noticed <em>yesterday</em>!</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 12th: It&rsquo;s been 8 days, 2 hours, 30 minutes and 6 seconds&hellip;</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/weebly8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ok, seriously, what the hell?</p>

<p>At this point, Weebly is seriously <em>threatening</em> me into publishing my website. Gone are the informative email subject lines: now, Weebly simply <em>reminds</em> me how much time I&rsquo;ve spent not working on a website. They&rsquo;ve graduated from passive-aggressive to just aggressive.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s genuinely terrifying is that Weebly actually created a custom email message to send to users to send after a week of having an unpublished site. <em>They tested this email behavior and thought this was a good idea.</em> Apparently, they never considered that a user could exist solely to contribute to another user&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>Some might say that I should have unsubscribed if I was unhappy with Weebly&rsquo;s emails. Indeed, all the e-mails had unsubscribe links, hidden where most people won&rsquo;t see them of course. But that&rsquo;s not the point: if startups keep sending forward e-mails, <em>everyone</em> loses.</p>

<p>At the least, I&rsquo;m very cautious to recommend Weebly to anyone else.</p>

<hr>


<p><strong>UPDATE (5/14/13)</strong>: On the corresponding <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5704860">Hacker News thread</a>, David Rusenko, founder and CEO of Weebly, posted a response:</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d like to jump in and clarify a few things. First, we have recently been testing the frequency of our email sending, and the author seems to have been bucketed into the &ldquo;more frequent&rdquo; group. That being said, we were actually planning on reducing the frequency of what we emailed the author by roughly 25%, including eliminating the &ldquo;Your website misses you&rdquo; and the &ldquo;It’s been 8 days, 2 hours, 30 minutes and 6 seconds…&rdquo; emails, among others. I just fast-tracked this and it&rsquo;s now live, so our email volume when you sign up is now much lower.</p>

<p>Second, we put a lot of effort into trying to send personalized email communication that is specific to your use case, but it looks like we missed a very important group, contributors to others&#8217; sites. This was a mistake. These emails may make sense if you were starting your own site, but they certainly don&rsquo;t make sense if you were just contributing to someone else&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m going to make sure we revise that set of emails within 2 weeks to something more appropriate and even less frequent.</p>

<p>Last, as many here are correct to assume, we are constantly testing and refining our email communications. I think it&rsquo;s helpful to understand our customer&rsquo;s psychology when they are signing up for Weebly, it is instructive in understanding our thought process and why we send the emails we do.
Most of our customers (60%) consider themselves entrepreneurs. They are bringing a new idea to life, things like chairigami.com, themintspace.com, stealthelectricbikesusa.com or weeknightbite.com. They are quitting their full-time jobs to do this and it&rsquo;s a very frightening process.</p>

<p>Creating their site is especially daunting and difficult for them, even though it&rsquo;s so crucial to their success. Many of them start the process, want to finish, but give up. We&rsquo;ve found that the first week is the most crucial. In our email communications, it&rsquo;s our goal to try to help them across the finish line to a high-quality site.</p>

<p>In this case, we were emailing too often, and we&rsquo;ve stopped doing that. In general, most of our users do appreciate some help and encouragement along the way, and we will keep testing emails to try to make that as effective, helpful, and non-annoying as possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to hear that Weebly is aware of the issue, and I&rsquo;m thankful for David&rsquo;s response, although I&rsquo;ll still be keeping an eye on the close eye on how much spam they&rsquo;re still sending out.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-07T21:53:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/05/stones-of-jordan</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/">Diablo III</a>, Blizzard&rsquo;s highly-awaited online-only Action RPG released almost a year ago to the day, has had its share of technical difficulties. From <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/error-37">Error 37</a> to lag spikes that can cause hundreds of hours to go to waste, Blizzard has spent the past year improving the game backend to better accommidate the millions of active players.</p>

<p>Diablo III is also noted for its economy, with an emphasis on a region-wide auction house where players can trade one-in-a-million items for millions and billions of gold. (inflation is crazy). Additionally, Diablo III emphasized the use of a Real World Auction House, where players can sell gold or items for real world cash.</p>

<p>Today was the launch of <a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/9647272/patch-108-now-live-5-7-2013">Patch 1.0.8</a>, a patch which promised improvements to character progression. After spending a few weeks on a Public Test Realm, where players volunteered to tested the patch to ensure that there were game-breaking exploits, the patch released successfully.</p>

<p>Except for one patch note that was added last minute and not tested in the PTR. And it&rsquo;s a patch note that broke the economy to tiny pieces.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The patch notes from the final build contained this change:</p>

<blockquote><p>The stack size for gold sales on the auction house has been increased from 1 million to 10 million.</p></blockquote>

<p>Normally, on the Real Money Auction House, the player can only sell money in 1 million gold increments. In 1.0.8, the player can sell it in 10 million increments. So, what happens when the player tries putting an absurd amount of money on the Auction House?</p>

<p>Reddit user tyropro <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1dx3wv/some_speculation_on_how_the_gold_bug_made_it_to/">has a nice explanation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The gold &ldquo;dupe&rdquo; involved creating a RMAH auction for billions of gold while staying under the $250 limit. The example I saw in a video was 6 billion gold (600 x 10,000,000 at $0.39 per stack, for $234). When they posted this auction only ~1.7 billion appeared to be for sale, with the rest &ldquo;missing&rdquo; until they sent it to their stash and ended up with more than they started with. The exact numbers from a duping video:</p>

<pre><code>Create RMAH auction for:            6,000,000,000 gold
Auction shows up as:                1,705,032,704 gold
This much is missing!               4,294,967,296 gold
The missing amount, divided by 2:   2,147,483,648 gold
</code></pre>

<p>2,147,483,648 (or 231) is the maximum value you can store in an int32 in programming. I&rsquo;m no programmer, but I took one class in high school and was taught about the limits of different variable types. See:</p>

<p>Simply put, their RMAH gold selling code wasn&rsquo;t written to handle numbers over 2,147,483,648 properly, and the result was duplicate gold being added to people&rsquo;s stashes.</p></blockquote>

<p>4,294,967,296 is also 232, or the bound on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)#Common_long_integer_sizes">unsigned integer</a>, which would be an interesting implementation choice on Blizzard&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>And so, the dupers created these 6-billion-gold auctions which only appears to sell as 1.7 billion (and therefore only had 1.7 billion deducted from the current balance), canceled them, and were fully refunded the 6 billion for a net profit of the difference (4.2 billion). Repeat <em>ad nauseum</em>.</p>

<p>A popular game streamer showed off the exploit. Other streamers followed. It was easily reproducible and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1dw9kr/there_is_a_gold_dupe_on_na_currently_this_is_the/">everyone knew how to reproduce it</a>.</p>

<p>Hilarity ensued.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/diablo31.png" alt="diablo31" /></p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s 420 <em>billion</em> gold.</p>

<p>After buying up all the duped items in the Auction House, the items were then sold on the Real Money Auction House. For real money. And people bought them.</p>

<p>This is the definition of a worst-case scenario for Diablo III. All because of an untested patch note. What could Blizzard do? Performing a roll-back would wipe all progress obtained by players for the patch day, which would result in a lot of bad PR. But leaving the economy as-is will devalue all items in the game (and Diablo III is all about getting items).</p>

<p>In the end, Blizzard <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1dx4a7/there_will_officially_be_no_rollback_after_the/">has not done a roll-back</a>, but instead <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1dwk6x/d3_inigomontoya_just_got_banned_for_real/">banned anyone who duped</a>, and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/x5S9Zcx.png">refunded</a> anyone who spent real money. The bug was temporarily fixed by reverting the patch note which caused the entire mess.</p>

<p>Let this be a lesson on what happens when you include an untested change at the last minute. You could break an entire economy. Eh, no big deal.</p>
