    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Statisticians like to use data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/">United States Census</a> to plot interesting trends such as unemployment and population of regions across the country. However, such data is typically historical and not very robust.</p>

<p>Facebook, on the other hand, has collected a large amount of data though its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/location">Places product</a>. Facebook Places allows users to &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; a place such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dolores-Park/105687759464007">Dolores Park</a> in a manner similar to <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/dolores.png"></p>

<p>Through clever use of Facebook&rsquo;s Graph API and FQL, I was able to retrieve the data on all Facebook Places in and around San Francisco, along with the # of check-ins at each Place. With the data on approximately 8,000 Facebook Places in San Francisco, we can map where San Franciscans are checking-in, and determine what types of locations they like to visit.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the distribution of check-ins among Places in San Francisco:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-checkin-distribution.png"></p>

<p>On a logarithmic scale, the shape resembles a bell curve with a center at about 800 check-ins; however, the sample average of check-ins for the data set is <strong>3,241 check-ins</strong>, indicating that the data may be heavily skewed to the right. Some Places don&rsquo;t have many check-ins, while some Places have an incredibly large number of check-ins.</p>

<p>What are the Places with hundreds of thousands of check-ins? What does the city look like with all these Places plotted on a map of San Francisco?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-checkin.png"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cykofhlyus8atgw/sf-bubble.pdf">(PDF of Map)</a></em></p>

<p>The most checked-in Places are, unsurprisingly, the famous tourist attractions of San Francisco, such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ATT-Park/116440731717551">AT&amp;T Park</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UnionSquareSF">Union Square</a>. These Top Places are spread all over the city.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also clear where the most dense areas are located in San Francisco. There are plainly-visible lines of Places along southern Mission Street and Outer Sunset. SOMA and Richmond have a large number of Places as well.</p>

<p>And yes, 155,000 people really did check-into <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Cheesecake-Factory/107178672654937">The Cheesecake Factory</a>.</p>

<h1>What types of locations do people in San Francisco  frequently check-into?</h1>

<p>Facebook also records the category of its Places, such as &ldquo;Bar&rdquo; and &ldquo;Restaurant&rdquo;. What are the most numerous types of locations in San Francisco?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-checkin-distribution-count.png"></p>

<p>Local businesses are by far the most frequent, as it&rsquo;s a more generic classifier for a Place and can be applied to anything that does not have an explicit classifier (such as startups). I find it interesting that non-profit organizations are more numerous than shopping centers.</p>

<p>However, the quantity of a specific type of business does not necessarily mean that San Franciscians will check-into that type of Place more often. Which type of Place, on average, receives the greatest number of check-ins?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-checkin-distribution-avg.png"></p>

<p>People are more likely to check-into memorable Places and events, instead of Places they frequently visit like Bars and Restaurants (Twice as many people check-into Attractions than Clubs). Again, tourist attractions are the most popular, which is due to both the relatively low number of Places and the extremely high number of check-ins into Places such as AT&amp;T Park.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Lake&rdquo; corresponds to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lake-Merced/113785468632283">Lake Merced</a>, if you&rsquo;re curious.</p>

<h1>Which San Francisco neighborhoods are the most popular?</h1>

<p>You saw earlier that the Facebook Places are concentrated in specific areas. Here&rsquo;s a map of San Francisco&rsquo;s neighborhoods, highlighted by the number of Places within:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-places-count.png"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/63fgvcucvk9n9v3/sf-sum.pdf">(PDF of Map)</a></em></p>

<p>The neighborhoods with the most Places are unsurprisingly where the trendy areas are, such as the Mission and SOMA. Additionally, those types of neighborhoods are larger in square area than others, which may bias the results in their favor.</p>

<p>But are these large neighborhoods also the most active neighborhoods? Which neighborhoods have the most check-ins on average per Place within the neighborhood?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sf-places-avg.png"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u613oh4fskjrkny/sf-avg.pdf">(PDF of Map)</a></em></p>

<p>The Embarcadero has by far the most check-ins on average, again, due to both its small size and AT&amp;T Park. Other neighborhoods, however, have more similar averages to each other. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the average number of check-ins is higher in neighborhoods adjacent to the San Francisco Bay, such as North Beach and Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf: perhaps people check-in more frequently when they have a good view.</p>

<p>Can this data and conclusions about San Francisco Facebook Places be extrapolated to other cities? I&rsquo;d argue yes: it makes logical sense that people check-in more frequently to Places that are more significant, and it also makes sense that people frequently check-into Places with large amounts of tourist attractions. Facebook data shows us cool trends that the United States Census data cannot.</p>

<p><em>All charts and maps were made using R, ggplot2, and ggmaps.</em></p>

<p><em>You can download a copy of the Facebook Places data set <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6g6ap4poz1b2trs/sf-public.csv">here</a>. The place_id column corresponds to the San Francisco neighborhood where the Place is located.</em></p>

<p><em>Maps are from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>. San Francisco shape files for city neighborhoods are from <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Service-Requests-311-/Neighborhoods/ejmn-jyk6">data.sf.gov</a>. Additionally, thanks to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/223ubt/map_of_places_in_san_francisco_by_of_facebook/">/r/dataisbeautiful</a> for offering ideas for improvements to the maps.</em></p>

<p><em>You may notice that the Check-In Counts on some of the official Facebook Place Pages strongly disagree with the Count reported in my charts. The Count reported on affected page is nearly double the value reported via the API in each instance. I believe this is a bug on Facebook&rsquo;s end: see <a href="http://i.imgur.com/I1syBhR.png">this image</a>, in which the Graph Search autocomplete reports a different value of check-ins than the Place Page itself. In this case, I trust the data from the API.</em></p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/03/hashtag-tag/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-24T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/03/hashtag-tag</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> uses hashtags as a method of categorizing images and videos. A user can tag an image with, for example, #snowy, and all other Instagram app users can see a mosaic of photos from all users which have that tag. Many less-than-honest  Instagram users <a href="http://instagram.com/p/l5J7iXQGX6/">spam tags</a> which are not particularly relevant to their photo in order to maximize the potential exposure.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/instatags2.png"></p>

<p>At a maximum of 30 tags per image, spamming large numbers of tags should theoretically have a huge impact on the image&rsquo;s reach. In fact, there are sketchy websites that provide premade lists of popular hashtags for you to spam. But does spamming #tags in an Instagram image <em>actually</em> lead to a increase in the number of Likes on an image?</p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a>, I&rsquo;ve retrieved about 120,000  images, split evenly between pictures tagged with #sunny, #rainy, and #snowy, to get a good range of neutral picture types. Here&rsquo;s the distribution of the number of tags on photos from that data set:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/instagram-tags.png"></p>

<p>The majority of Instagram photos have around 5 tags, which is a reasonable amount for a user quickly classifying a photo within the photo caption. However, it&rsquo;s clear that there are many tag abusers, with a noticeable spike of  the number of Instagram photos which have the maximum of 30 #tags. (the statistical average is <strong>11.45 tags</strong>, with a standard deviation of 8.01)</p>

<p>The distribution of Likes as heavily skewed as you would expect when viewed normally, but when the distribution is viewed on a logarithmic scale, the shape becomes closer to a bell curve:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/instagram-likes.png"></p>

<p>The statistical average of Likes on Instagram photos is <strong>26.19 Likes</strong>, with a standard deviation of 154.07; the high standard deviation is caused by the few photos with thousands of Likes.</p>

<p>If you analyze the distribution of Likes for each discrete number of tags, the results are more telling.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/instagram-likes-facet.png"></p>

<p>As the number of tags increases, the distribution of Likes shifts toward right, with very, very few photos with less than 10 likes. However, due to the logarithmic scaling, it&rsquo;s hard to tell if the center of the distibution (where the average number of Likes is approximately located) is shifting significantly.</p>

<h1>Regression Analysis</h1>

<p>A simple linear regression of log(Likes) on tags can tell us of the if an increase in the number of tags corresponds to an increase in the number of Likes.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/instagram-tags-scatterplot.png"></p>

<p>There is indeed a <strong>very strong positive relationship between Tags and Likes</strong>, with a p-value &lt; 2e-16 for the tag regression coefficient. But tags alone doesn&rsquo;t explain the variance of Likes particularly well (R<sup>2</sup> = 15.47%) due to the heavy variance of Likes in the raw data, even after using a logarithmic transformation. However, due to the logarithmic transformation, it&rsquo;s difficult to easily determine the relative difference in the amount of Likes between using 1 tag on an Instagram photo and using 30 tags.</p>

<p>Using the raw, untransformed data, this is a chart of the average number of Likes on photos from the sample data for each discrete number of tags, with 95% confidence intervals* for each measure:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/instagram-tag-average.png"></p>

<p>Instagram photos which have the maximum of 30 #tags receive, on average, about <strong>three times</strong> as many Likes than photos with only a few tags. Most of the averages are well-bounded, too, which indicate that the per-tag-Like-averages are well-representative of all Instagram photos.</p>

<p>The strong deviations from the trend (and larger confidence intervals) at 1, 5, and 9 tags are due to large outliers which skew the average. Indeed, there are many other factors in determining the expected number of Likes for an Instagram photo (e.g. the popularity of the person who posted the photo), some of which I hope to cover in a future blog post. :)</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want more Likes on your filtered photos, spam those hashtags. You won&rsquo;t be guaranteed to gets lots of Likes, but the odds will greatly be in your favor.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A Statistical Analysis of All Hacker News Submissions]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/hacking-hacker-news/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-24T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/hacking-hacker-news</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> is a very popular link aggregator for the technology and startup community. Officially titled <a href="http://ycombinator.com/hackernews.html">by Paul Graham in 2007</a>, Hacker News began mostly as a place where the very computational-savvy could submit stories around the internet and discuss the latest computing trends.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-wordcloud-2007i.png"></p>

<p>Back then, people were talking about networking, software users, and a little up-and-coming startup known as &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Six years later, during the new renaissance of computing accessibility and startup entrepreneurship, not much has changed.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-wordcloud-2013i.png"></p>

<p>Hacker News, from 2007 to 2014, always illustrates what&rsquo;s &ldquo;new&rdquo; in technology. After downloading all 1,265,114 Hacker News submissions from the official <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">Hacker News API</a>, I gathered a few interesting statistics which show the true impact of Hacker News.</p>

<h1>How many stories are submitted to Hacker News?</h1>

<p>In the past few years, Hacker News has had an interesting growth pattern.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-monthly-submissions.png"></p>

<p>From the beginning of 2010 with 12k monthly submissions to to the end of 2011 with 31k monthly submissions, the amount of monthly submissions to Hacker News nearly tripled. It&rsquo;s a similar growth rate to that of the startups that Y Combinator typically funds.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s <em>really</em> interesting is that the end of 2011 is the peak: since then, the amount of submissions has been trending downward. Is Hacker News dying?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. Hacker News implements a proprietary anti-spam algorithm which &ldquo;kills&rdquo; submissions, and moderators can kill submissions manually if necessary. Killed articles do not appear in the submission count, so a change in policy would cause the discrepancy. At the least, it helps improve the quality of discussion.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE (2/28): Paul Graham, in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7291531">corresponding HN thread</a>,  made a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7292094">comment</a> that the anti-spam algorithm did indeed increase spam detection and number of article killed at the end of 2011.</em></p>

<h1>How many submissions receive large amounts of points?</h1>

<p>On Hacker News, users are able to upvote submissions. The more upvotes a submission has, the higher the position that it appears on the front page of the main site. A simple heuristic for calculating exposure from a Hacker News front page submission is 100 page views per point minimum, which means a submission that earns hundreds of points can go viral very quickly!</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hntop.png"></p>

<p>But how many submissions actually make it to the front page, and how many actually make it to the top?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-points-hist.png"></p>

<p>On a logarithmic scale, it&rsquo;s evident that the vast majority of Hacker News submissions don&rsquo;t even hit 10 points. (the average amount of points for a submission is 9.51). Usually, hitting 10 points is the sign that you&rsquo;ve appeared on the front page atleast briefly; there, the submission either receives voting momentum or dies quickly due to other rising stars.</p>

<p>But how many submissions <em>do</em> receive hundreds of points? Here&rsquo;s a chart of submissions by month which have received more than 100 points:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-monthly-submissions-front.png"></p>

<p>The growth rate of top-scoring submissions is correlated with the growth rate of Hacker News submissions themselves, which is not surprising. The number of points a post receives is also dependent on the number of users; as Hacker News grows, the number of users grows as well. Even though the front page cycles frequently, there is still room for great content.</p>

<h1>When is the best time to submit to Hacker News?</h1>

<p>The age old question. What is the best time to post such that your post makes it to the front page?</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s see when Hacker News has the most activity by observing the average number of submissions for each combination of submission hour and weekday:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-submissions.png"></p>

<p>Hacker News activity is most active at around 12 PM EST / 9 AM PST at about 40 submissions per hour, when hackers on the East Coast submit just before eating lunch, and hackers on the West Coast submit just after getting to work. Weekends, unsurprisingly, are completely dead.</p>

<p>If you submitted your link at 12 PM, you&rsquo;d have a lot competition, but it would be easier to get upvotes since there would be more people visiting the site. If you submitted your post on the weekend, there would be no competition, but would be harder to make the front page.</p>

<p>What is the best weekday + hour to submit such that your submission goes viral? An easy way to estimate the best time is to analyze the times of submission of previous posts with large amounts of points; with enough data (we have enough), it&rsquo;ll provide a strong guess.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-front-page.png"></p>

<p>As it turns out, the submission times of posts are <em>uncorrelated</em> with the number of viral posts. There are <em>slightly</em> more when submitting at peak activity (weekdays at 12 PM EST / 9 AM PST), but it won&rsquo;t make-or-break an article&rsquo;s success on HN.</p>

<p>Having good content is more important to having a post get to the top of Hacker News. Although you probably shouldn&rsquo;t submit an article when there&rsquo;s a major tech event. (e.g. Facebook&rsquo;s WhatsApp Purchase)</p>

<p><em>UPDATE (2/28): It&rsquo;s been pointed out that measuring the proportion of viral posts (number of viral submissions / number of total submissions) would be a better indicator of odds of article success. Since the number of viral submissions is similar across all time zones, the proportion of viral posts would be greatest on the weekends, since there are dramatically fewer total submissions. However, this logic isn&rsquo;t perfectly correct due to how the article discovery and upvoting system works. I may cover this in a future post.</em></p>

<h1>Do Y Combinator startup announcements score better on HN?</h1>

<p>One of the main benefits of Hacker News is to showcase the startups which Y Combinator has funded. Links about YC Startups contain the YC class name of that startup in their title, such as &ldquo;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6103506">Watsi (YC W13) raises $1.2M first-of-its-kind philanthropic seed round</a>.&rdquo; Do these links perform better than the typical links submitted to Hacker News?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-points-class-hist.png"></p>

<p>As it turns out, yes. For normal posts, the average number of points is 9.5 points, but for YC class announcements, the average is 41.7 points (from 1,745 submissions analyzed).</p>

<p>For fun, which YC classes perform the best on Hacker News?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-top-class.png"></p>

<p>W06 placed first because of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2481576">two</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2481610">announcements</a> about Wufoo, and S11 placed second because of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6585071">CryptoSeal</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2846725">Parse</a>.</p>

<h1>Who are the best submitters on Hacker News?</h1>

<p>Like all popular link aggregators, Hacker News has many spammers who submit large amounts of low quality content. Who are the users who submit quality content?</p>

<p>Calculating the average points of a user&rsquo;s submitted content isn&rsquo;t an accurate measurement, since that can be heavily skewed by one viral post. Therefore, I created a Hacker News &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average">batting average</a>&rdquo; statistic: which posters have the highest proportion of posts that make it to the front page vs. the total number submitted? (for posts since 2010 and number of submitted posts >= 10)</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-top-submitters.png"></p>

<p>It should be no surprise that most of the people on the list are startup founders. It&rsquo;s also not surprising that most of those founders, such as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mwseibel">mwseibel</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rahulvohra">rahulvohra</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tikhon">tikhon</a> also founded a Y Combinator startup. (although Paul Graham <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pg">himself</a> only has a 0.856 average).</p>

<h1>What are Hacker News&#8217; favorite programming languages?</h1>

<p>One of the infamous memes about Hacker News is programming language elitism, with favoritism for languages such as Lisp and Erlang.</p>

<p>But what programming languages are indeed the most popular on Hacker News?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-lang-num-submissions.png"></p>

<p>Javascript is very popular, especially with the rising popularity of node.js. Go is unexpectedly frequently submitted for being such a new language. (although it&rsquo;s possible for &ldquo;go&rdquo; to be used in a context outside of a programing language.) Lisp and Erlang are indeed obscure, which might discredit the meme.</p>

<p>Which programming languages are most well-liked on HN?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-lang-avg-submissions.png"></p>

<p>&hellip;so Lisp and Erlang <em>are</em> well-liked on HN.</p>

<p>At the least, in both cases, no one on Hacker News likes PHP.</p>

<h1>Snowden and Bitcoin</h1>

<p>Edward Snowden&rsquo;s leaks in June 2013 about the NSA and PRISM affected the entire tech industry, including Hacker News. How did Hacker News react to the leaks?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-snowden.png"></p>

<p>Strongly.</p>

<p>But after the June spike, discussion about the NSA decreased significantly, but it&rsquo;s still a popular topic.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is more interesting since it has had three distinct surges:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hn-bitcoin.png"></p>

<p>The June 2011 spike was due to the theft of <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=16457.0">25,000 Bitcoin</a>, the April 2013 spike happened during the first rise-and-fall from $200/BTC, and the November 2013 spike happened during the second rise-and-fall from $1,000/BTC.</p>

<p>Hacker News is a great model for a link aggregator.  It emphasizes more on quality content than the quantity of content, and it has paid off over the years.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Code for getting all the HN submissions is <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-download-all-stories">available on GitHub</a>. Unfortunately, the Hacker News data is too large to distribute freely. <a href="http://minimaxir.com/contact/">Contact me</a> if you want the raw data or any data to reproduce the charts.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: there appear to be <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zdex42KE-8DFIHujhVWjJ3yqilJSws2EbT8VAARPYgE/edit?usp=sharing">some gaps in the data</a> for dates before 2010. This appears to be caused by the API server: for example, compare the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=liebke">number of submissions as reported by HN for top user liebke</a> (21) and the <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?tags=story,author_liebke">number of submissions as reported by the API</a> for liebke (14, with the last 7 submitted stories missing relative to the HN output). Also, number of stories (1,265,114) in the output data and the <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/">server data</a> (~1,267,000 as of publishing) are very close, making the discrepancy unlikely caused by client error. As a result, any chart that is based on a time series does not start earlier than 2010.</em></p>

    <updated>2014-02-18T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/glory-to-the-helix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue_Versions">Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue</a> remain as two of the most iconic games in video gaming history. They have retained a lot of nostalgia value for those who grew up playing the games (such as myself), and nowadays even adult gamers revisit such classics.</p>

<p>On the game live-streaming site <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a>, one user simply known as &ldquo;TwitchPlaysPokemon&rdquo; setup <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon">a live-stream of Pokemon Red</a>, but with a twist: all game commands, such as &ldquo;up&rdquo;,&ldquo;down&rdquo;,&ldquo;left&rdquo;,&ldquo;right&rdquo;,&ldquo;b&rdquo;,&ldquo;a&rdquo;,&ldquo;select&rdquo;, and &ldquo;start&rdquo;, would be input by typing the appropriate command into the livestream chat. At first, this seems like a crazy idea: if thousands of people are inputting commands at the same time, could we accomplish <em>anything</em> in the game?</p>

<p>As it turns out, it was an idea that had gone horribly right. By the time gaming forum NeoGAF <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=768965">found the stream</a>, the channel had made an unexpected amount of progress; a group of 3,000 viewes made it past the first Gym (out of eight) and continued to move forward. A few days later, after the channel was covered by <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/17/5420334/twitch-plays-pokemon-captivates-with-more-than-6-5m-total-views">major news outlets</a>, the channel had completed <em>four</em> gyms, inspired the creation of a large amount of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Luwz9wr8XkoekzU4zv3duj9D2K5AoAyqnYMcbCHZKqc">hilarious fan art</a>, and also created a <a href="http://askhelixfossil.com/">new religion</a>. You can read a summary of the stream&rsquo;s status <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/minimaxir.com/document/d/1Ka89uCBeLl9VV5GPlAKuW7yF8FGtnVmdbPnIwG8FnQ4/preview?pli=1&amp;sle=true">here</a>.</p>

<p>That being said, it was neither a straight nor short path to success. In the end, the gaming community fought its greatest enemy: itself. Twitch Plays Pokemon isn&rsquo;t about winning. It&rsquo;s about trying not to fail spectacularly. And they still fail regardless. It&rsquo;s an irresistible train wreck that&rsquo;s hard to stop watching.</p>

<h1>The Adventure Begins</h1>

<p>The first areas of Pokemon Red are relatively linear up until <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vermilion_City">Vermilion City</a>, where the third gym is located. Before that, Pokemon Trainer Red, the player character, had a few interesting encounters thanks to the bizarre overlords of the Twitch chat. Red chose <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charmander">Charmander</a> (later evolved into <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Charmeleon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Charmeleon</a>) as his starter Pokemon, which he nicknamed <strong>ABBBBBBK (</strong> or &ldquo;Abby&rdquo; for short. He caught a few more basic Pokemon, including a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pidgey">Pidgey</a> (later evolved into <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pidgeotto_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Pidgeotto</a>) and <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pidgeot_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Pidgeot</a>), 2 <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rattata">Rattata</a> (one nicknamed <strong>JLVWNNOOOO</strong>, i.e. &ldquo;Jay Leno&rdquo;), a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Drowzee">Drowzee</a>, and a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Spearow">Spearow</a> which was traded for a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Farfetch%27d">Farfetch&rsquo;d</a>, all of which gave him a full party of Pokemon.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/MwarCER.png"></p>

<p>Since thousands of players are inputting commands at the same time, there is absolutely no strategy involved in Pokemon battles, which in most cases make the battles unwinnable. Thanks to the nature of RPG level-ups and a few lucky critical hits, Red can still persevere (although it will a few hours).</p>

<p>The Twitch channel was a very casual experience, until Red obtained HM 01 from the <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/S.S._Anne">S.S. Anne</a>, an item that requires a sequence of sequential button presses to operate.</p>

<p>Then things get complicated.</p>

<h1>Cutting A Thin Line</h1>

<p>HM 01 is an item that grants the Cut ability to a Pokemon, which is required to cut trees blocking progress; in this case, the tree in front of the Vermilion City Gym. In order to teach a Pokemon Cut, the player must:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring up the Start menu.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Items.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Select HM 01.</li>
<li>Confirm that HM 01 is to be used.</li>
<li>Select a Pokemon to learn Cut.</li>
<li>Confirm that the selected Pokemon is to learn Cut.</li>
<li>Choose a move for Cut to replace.</li>
</ol>


<p>The kicker? Pressing the B button or choosing the wrong option during <em>any</em> of these 7 steps takes the process back a step.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/1XSdWPY.jpg"></p>

<p>At this point in the stream, the audience hit 30,000 viewers. The increased activity caused an input delay of about 20 seconds from when the Twitch user input the command in chat to when the game recognized the command. This can make navigating menus difficult when an &ldquo;up&rdquo; or a &ldquo;down&rdquo; command is applied to a menu that isn&rsquo;t even visible yet.</p>

<p>Additionally, as the number of viewers in a stream increases, the number of trolls increases. And those trolls loved to spam the B button command.</p>

<p>Thanks to these two factors, the channel had failed to teach any Pokemon Cut for over <em>4 hours</em>. The stream chat became a bloodbath of blame.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/p30F3g7.png"></p>

<p>Eventually, it happened. The Farfetch&rsquo;d was taught Cut. No one knows <em>how</em>, but it happened. But <em>that</em> was only one step towards progress.</p>

<p>The second step is actually Cutting the tree. In order to Cut:</p>

<ol>
<li>Face the tree.</li>
<li>Bring up the Start menu.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Pokemon&rdquo;</li>
<li>Select the Pokemon with Cut.</li>
<li>Select Cut.</li>
</ol>


<p>Same kickers as before, too. Facing the tree is even harder since the same up/down commands for navigating the menus can reorient Red away from the tree.</p>

<p>It took another 4 hours to cut down that tree. Later, when Red was defeated in the Gym, the tree respawned. Yeah.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/NCo5N3j.png"></p>

<p>HM 01 was a harsh reminder that the more people present, the higher the chance that your task will fail. Not necessarily due to incompetence and disorganization, but due to mischief.</p>

<h1>Fighting The Ledge Boss</h1>

<p>After the Vermilion City Gym was (eventually) completed, the Twitch stream progressed through <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Route_9">Route 9</a> toward <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lavender_Town">Lavender Town</a>. Sounds simple, until Red hit this obstacle.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/ledge.png"></p>

<p>Red must walk from the left to the right through the 1-character-wide path. If Red went down, the ledge is a one-way drop, and Red must walk back to the beginning to try again.</p>

<p>The Twitch chat must go &ldquo;right&rdquo; about 8 times <em>without going &ldquo;down&rdquo; at all</em>.</p>

<p>HM01 had input lag as a contributing factor to its failures. In this case, the trolls had <em>all</em> the power. One &ldquo;down&rdquo; ends the entire attempt. And the stream was even more popular with an audience of 50,000 people.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/h2sFCtt.png"></p>

<p>The result? Crossing the ledge took over <em>12 hours</em>. And then Red was defeated by the trainer at the end of the ledge and so getting back across the ledge took an equally absurd amount of time.</p>

<p>Lesson learned? If trolls have absolute power, <em>they will use it</em> and they will use it without mercy.</p>

<p><em>EDIT 2/19: The defeat of the ledge boss was due to the intervention of another Twitch channel which <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/1y1ee8/the_meta_strat_or_how_we_beat_the_ledge/">executed a meta-strategy</a>: press &ldquo;right&rdquo; in sync with the input delay: with enough people, Red would move right enough times.</em></p>

<h1>Disregarding Decision Trees</h1>

<p>After the ledge incident, the fanbase became paranoid. What other gameplay aspects in this playthrough could be compromised by trolls in the future? One concern is the PC system used to store Pokemon; the same system can also <em>release</em> them, removing them from the game forever. The risk of losing a top Pokemon to the PC due to trolls was too great and would make the game nearly unwinnable, and therefore the stream decided to avoid using the PC unless necessary.</p>

<p>Red progressed through Lavender Town and arrived at <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Celadon_City">Celadon City</a>, where the Twitch channel defeated the Gym Leader for the fourth badge (it took awhile: there was a tree outside <em>and</em> inside the gym!)</p>

<p>At this point in Pokemon Red, the game becomes more nonlinear, which started a debate on what next to do in game. Many pointed out that the party lacked a Pokemon which could learn Surf, a skill, like Cut, which was required to progress in the game much later. Red will eventually earn such a Pokemon which could learn Surf (<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lapras">Lapras</a>) as a part of the plot, who&rsquo;s a decent combatant too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the player can also collect <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eevee">Eevee</a> as a free Pokemon. Eevee has three evolutions: the terrible <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Flareon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Flareon</a>, the good <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Jolteon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Jolteon</a>, and the great <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vaporeon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Vaporeon</a> who can also learn Surf. But in order to evolve Vaporeon Eevee into , the party must a) buy a Water Stone, and not accidentally any other elemental stone instead and b) use the Stone <em>without accidentally tossing it</em> and destroying it. Both of which are difficult due to input lag and trolls.</p>

<p>The party had 5 Pokemon (after a Rattata was deposited  earlier into the PC), and so the stream only had the opportunity for get <em>one</em> Pokemon, since the stream did not want deposit any in the PC for fear of release. Which is the more rational path for getting a Pokemon with Surf: waiting to get a guaranteed Lapras, or getting the Eevee and hope the stream can evolve it into a Vaporeon? A guaranteed decent Pokemon or a chance at a great Pokemon?</p>

<p>As it turns out, when 70,000 people make a decision, they aren&rsquo;t exactly rational. Instead, hilarity ensued.</p>

<h1>Game Over Theory</h1>

<p>The stream obtained the Eevee (even after many said it was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9cV06Yq.png">a bad idea</a>) and went to purchase a Water Stone. Due to input manipulation, they instead bought a Fire Stone, and later the Eevee evolved into the unhelpful Flareon. Chat becomes a bloodbath once again.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/QGiFYYu.jpg"></p>

<p>In order to make room for Lapras in the future, the stream attempted to use a PC to deposit Flareon.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/0ndYCF1.png"></p>

<p>Instead, both Abby and Jay Leno were permanently released.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/tumblr_n157ldJl611rvlenbo1_1280.jpg"></p>

<p>The stream became completely derailed.</p>

<p>As of today, Twitch pushes on, but everyone who&rsquo;s participating in the stream has now learned a lesson: people act in their self interest and do what they think is best. Trolls have&hellip;different self-interests. And there will always be trolls. Knowing how to fail gracefully is always valuable.</p>

<p>At the least, the amount of progress the stream has made is still very, very impressive and unexpected.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/the-filter-truth/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-10T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/the-filter-truth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> photos have filters applied to make them look more retro/cool. Instagram users are also able to apply tags to a photo to help categorize and promote them to the Instagram community. One such tag, #nofilter, is intended to emphasize such natural beauty that no filter is necessary to enhance the image. (or the photographer is just too lazy to decide on a filter)</p>

<p>But how many #nofilter images actually <em>have</em> no filter?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/instagram_selfie.gif"></p>

<p>As it turns not, not all of them.</p>

<p>After retrieving about 50,000 images through the Instagram API (code <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/get-data-from-photos-from-instagram-tags">available on GitHub</a>), here is the breakdown of filters on #nofilter-tagged Instagram images:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/nofilter.png"></p>

<p>Only 83% of #nofilter images have no filter?! You had one job, Instagram! :(</p>

<hr />

<p><em>The actual reason that this is happening is because Instagram rewards #tagspamming. More on that in a future blog post.</em></p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/moved-temporarily/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-06T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/moved-temporarily</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>. Image links without gimmicks. But recently, I noticed that whenever I clicked an Imgur link on Facebook or Twitter, it  navigated me to the main image page, with loads of blank empty space and links to other Imgur images instead of just showing me only the image. I double-check the URL, and it indeed begins with the &ldquo;i&rdquo; subdomain that indicates a direct link to the image, such as &ldquo;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/p9lG2ss.png">http://i.imgur.com/p9lG2ss.png</a>&rdquo;, so what&rsquo;s happening?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/imgur_direct.png"></p>

<p>As it turns out, when clicking a direct image link for the first time on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, Imgur will <strong>redirect</strong> you to the main image page instead. Try clicking the link in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=i.imgur.com&amp;src=typd">any i.imgur.com URL on Twitter</a>. The main image page has a &ldquo;follow us on Facebook/Twitter!&rdquo; button on desktops, or an advertisement on mobile devices.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/imgur_link.gif"></p>

<p>This behavior isn&rsquo;t particularly honest and upfront.</p>

<p>But is Imgur redirecting links from only these social media sites? Are these redirects an accident or are they deliberate?</p>

<p>A quick and dirty way to check is to use the command line. The <em>curl</em> command loads the data from a specified website. An optional parameter is <em>referrer</em>, which &ldquo;spoofs&rdquo; the URL of the website where the user is navigating from.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I wanted to &ldquo;access&rdquo; an image direct link coming from a website I know Imgur is not redirecting, such as Reddit. I run this command in the Windows Command Prompt or the Mac Terminal:</p>

<p><code>curl http://i.imgur.com/p9lG2ss.png --referer http://reddit.com -I</code></p>

<p>That gives me a Status Code 200, &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, meaning that the image was accessed successfully.</p>

<p><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: cloudflare-nginx
Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2014 01:41:40 GMT Content-Type: image/png [...]</code></p>

<p>Now what happens if the user accesses the link from Facebook or Twitter?</p>

<p><code>curl http://i.imgur.com/p9lG2ss.png --referer http://facebook.com -I</code></p>

<p>That returns something different.</p>

<p><code>HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Server: cloudflare-nginx
Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2014 01:44:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
[...]
Set-Cookie: __cfduid=dc2e0ae5ee57ff598e079d75fa628f0321391564643058; expires=Mon, 23-Dec-2019 23:50:00 GMT; path=/; domain=.imgur.com; HttpOnly
Location: http://imgur.com/p9lG2ss</code></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302">Status Code 302</a>, &ldquo;Moved Temporarily,&rdquo; is the error code for a redirect, and shows that Imgur implemented this behavior intentionally. It also provides the Location of the link to redirect to, in this case the default image page with Imgur&rsquo;s branding.</p>

<p>After checking all popular social media sites (and their respective URL shortners) as referrers against Imgur&rsquo;s direct image links, I determined that the only referrer domains that Imgur redirects are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://facebook.com">http://facebook.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://t.co">http://t.co</a></li>
<li><a href="http://plus.google.com">http://plus.google.com</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to share your cat photos and .gifs directly to friends, I guess you can still share them on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t say that what Imgur is doing is unethical; many startups use redirects to trap users and spam them with popups saying JOIN MY WEBSITE. At the least, your friends still get to see the image you linked. It&rsquo;s understandable why Imgur would use the redirects; direct image links cause them to lose money through bandwidth expense and earn none, while links to normal image pages make it apparent that the image is from Imgur, and the company could get new users from the branding. Many, many more direct links are made than indirect links, as shown in the image at the beginning of the article, and that can account for a lot of lost revenue.</p>

<p>The problem is that redirecting users without disclosure is the start of a slippery slope. When I post a direct image link by copying the &ldquo;Direct Link&rdquo; URL, I <em>expect</em> that others who use the link will also see the direct image. But that&rsquo;s not the case if the link is posted on Facebook or Twitter. Additionally, the redirects make the images take <em>much</em> longer to load on mobile, since loading the scripts and ads slow the entire page down. Making it so that the redirect is only seen the first time an image is viewed doesn&rsquo;t offer much solace.</p>

<p>If the redirects are successful at converting new users for Imgur, what&rsquo;s stopping them from redirecting other sites? I strongly hope that Imgur won&rsquo;t turn into the next Photobucket or Imageshack, but whenever a startup does something weird and not transparent, it&rsquo;s <em>never</em> a good sign.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/01/more-language-more-problems/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-20T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2014/01/more-language-more-problems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I was surfing Reddit and came across an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1ur3ny/unnecessary_graph_of_most_desired_skills_in_2013/">interesting infographic</a> within the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/">ProgrammerHumor subreddit</a>. The infographic, as compiled by tech blog <a href="http://readwrite.com/">ReadWrite</a>, depicts the Top 10 Most In-Demand Developer Skills of 2013, as compiled by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> through keyword searches.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/infographic-1.jpg"></p>

<p>Take a look at the chart. What’s good and bad about it?</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>

<p>The data is properly cited.</p>

<h1>The Bad</h1>

<p><strong>EVERYTHING ELSE.</strong></p>

<p>What’s terrible about the graph? Let me count the ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using discrete values in the X-Axis for a continuous measurement (i.e. the percentage). And not only that, discrete values with two significant figures, which make the X-Axis unusually cluttered.</p></li>
<li><p>The Y-Axis is Language. This implies that some programming languages are more language than others.  (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152166149970450&amp;set=a.432190050449.225968.582270449&amp;type=1&amp;stream_ref=10">to be fair</a>, Java is more language than Android)</p></li>
<li><p>Not all entries on the chart are programming languages. (Android, for example, is an operating system.)</p></li>
<li><p>The 45-degree line in the chart implies that the relationship between language and %-of-searches is perfectly linear, where in reality the data has an upward-parabolic shape.</p></li>
<li><p>No relative proportions between the programming languages. We can&rsquo;t accurately see the increase in language Java has relative to Android just by looking at the graph.</p></li>
<li><p>Cannot easily associate a language with the given X-Axis value. The logos representing the programming language oscillate around the line, and it&rsquo;s hard to see at a glance which percentage corresponds to which language.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Fixing the Chart</h1>

<p>This isn’t one of those blog posts that make snarky criticism without offering any constructive input. (those will be posted next week). How can we make the chart somewhat logical?</p>

<p>The easiest way to improve the chart is to convert the chart from a line chart to a column chart. Here’s a column chart that keeps the intended impression of the original chart:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/dev-graph-1.png"></p>

<p>A much bigger improvement, although unfortunately without the cool hand-drawn logos. The axes are no longer illogical and it’s easy to determine the relative impact of each language (e.g. Java is clearly, clearly at the top). However, the large amount of text can clutter the bars, and it can be difficult to correlate the raw percentage with the scale at a glance.</p>

<p>Another option is to rotate the chart and use bars instead of columns:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/dev-graph-2.png"></p>

<p>This fixes the text issue by giving more room for text with most of the factors, but the Java text clips outside the chart. The correlation issue between language and percent value persists.</p>

<p>A best-of-both-worlds approach is to display the language on the Y-Axis and the raw percent value on the corresponding bar itself, allowing us to forgo the percent metric axis entirely.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/dev-graph-3.png"></p>

<p>There we go. Minimalist, fixes both the text and correlation issues, and gets the point across effectively.</p>

<p>All of these charts were created using R and ggplot2, and you can download the R code in <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/developer-graphs">this GitHub repository</a>. I wish the <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/01/08/in-demand-tech-skills-of-2013-java">orginal ReadWrite article</a> used a chart like the last one and…</p>

<p>Wait, they changed the infographic?</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/infographic-2.jpg"></p>

<p>Hey, they fixed the chart, and it’s using a similar design as mine! What a crazy random happenstance!</p>

<p>The article was appended with an update:</p>

<blockquote><p>An earlier version of the infographic in this story presented the StackOverflow data in a confusing and conceptually problematic fashion. It has been updated.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Problematic&rdquo; is the world&rsquo;s biggest understatement.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jelly.co/">Jelly</a>, a highly-anticipated social networking app by Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, was released last week. One of Jelly&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.jelly.co/post/72563498393/introducing-jelly">underlying principles</a>  is &ldquo;it’s not hard to imagine that the true promise of a connected society is people helping each other.&rdquo; While using Jelly over the past few days, I&rsquo;ve seen people ask whether or not to exercise, make unsubtle plugs for their product, sell a car Craigslist-style, and get amnesia.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/jellyposts2.jpg"></p>

<p>Wait, what? How are these questions representative of &ldquo;a connected society,&rdquo; especially since I don&rsquo;t know any of the question authors?</p>

<p>Jelly tells its users that they can &ldquo;help friends, or friends-of-friends with their questions.&rdquo; The vast  majority of the questions I&rsquo;ve seen are from Friends of Friends. I&rsquo;m Facebook Friends with people who have <strong>thousands</strong> of friends; the probability that I have something in common with those second-degree friends is low.</p>

<p>Websites like Jelly and even Facebook are now utilizing the content made by second-degree &ldquo;friends.&rdquo; Why am I seeing pictures and statuses from friends of friends, who are essentially complete strangers?</p>

<h1>Facebook&rsquo;s Farcical Friends of Friends Folly</h1>

<p>A couple months ago, Facebook again tweaked the News Feed algorithm such that all new Posts on a friend&rsquo;s Wall are shown on your News Feed, even if the person making the Post is a complete stranger to you.</p>

<p>Originally, Facebook showed posts in your News Feed that were posted on a Friend&rsquo;s wall only if they were made by another Friend. If you are friends with both people, there&rsquo;s likely a common link between all three of you, such as going to the same college or working at the same company. That can make the Wall post more relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>However, people have many social circles. What happens when a stranger not in any of my social circles posts on a Friend&rsquo;s wall?</p>

<p>This post recently appeared in my News Feed:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/fb-stranger-wall.jpg"></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know who the person with &ldquo;1 mutual friend&rdquo; is. (the &ldquo;1 mutual friend&rdquo; being the friend who received the post). I don&rsquo;t live in Arizona. Why am I seeing this?</p>

<p>Although I may be Facebook Friends with someone, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean I should be Friends with their Friends. Facebook is showing me Posts that aren&rsquo;t relevant to me at all.</p>

<p>This behavior also extends to your Friends&#8217; birthday: all &ldquo;Happy Birthday!&rdquo; posts on your Friend&rsquo;s Wall also display in your News Feed.</p>

<p>This entry was visible on my News Feed for an entire day:</p>

<p>Facebook <strong>really</strong> wants you to wish your Friends happy birthday.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need to see strangers with &ldquo;1 mutual friend&rdquo; wish my friends Happy Birthday. It&rsquo;s just extra clutter on an already cluttered News Feed.</p>

<p>To be fair, other websites such as <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> push second-degree friends. Twitter&rsquo;s new <a href="https://twitter.com/i/discover">Discover</a> feature highlights users who the people you Follow are themselves Following. LinkedIn shows your connections&#8217; new connections so you can form connections with them too. But the difference between Twitter/LinkedIn and Facebook/Jelly is that both Facebook and Jelly push the power of <strong>intimate</strong> friendships, and imposing a sense of intimacy between strangers feels fake and intrudes on actual friendships.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/daily-reddit/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-18T07:30:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/daily-reddit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reddit has certainty received more attention in the mainstream media with its involvement in such events as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/business/media/bombings-trip-up-reddit-in-its-turn-in-spotlight.html?_r=0">Boston Marathon Bombings</a> and <a href="hhttp://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/">President Obama&rsquo;s AMA</a>. But has this publicity led to increase in overall activity on the site?</p>

<p>I analyzed the daily number of submissions from over two years, August 6th, 2011 to September 25, 2013 (41 million submissions total), to see which events, if any, have affected Reddit&rsquo;s growth rate. As it turns out, Reddit grows by itself.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/reddit_daily-mac.png"></p>

<p>Reddit&rsquo;s growth over the past two years has been almost entirely <strong>linear</strong>, with no notable acceleration in submission activity at any point in time.</p>

<p>Running a linear regression on daily number of submissions vs. number of days since the first date (8/6/11) reveals that the expected increase in number of submissions each successive day on average is <strong>66.48 submissions</strong>  (+1,948 submissions each successive month, +24,259 submissions each successive year)</p>

<p>This growth rate alone explains <strong>86.83%</strong> of the variation in number of submissions, indicating that external factors such as media publicity explain the remaining 13% of the variation.</p>

<p>From a business perspective, it&rsquo;s impressive that Reddit still continues to grow for being such a mature internet business, but prospective investors for a rumored <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/06/reddit-rumored-to-be-raising-money-at-a-400-million-valuation/">fundraising at a $400 Million valuation</a> might be weary that Reddit&rsquo;s growth is only linear, in contrast to the <strong>exponential</strong> growth of other startups such as Snapchat. (In fairness, submission activity may not necessarily correlate with revenue-driving content consumption activity)</p>

<p>A couple stray observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On January 18th, 2012, the daily number of Reddit submissions hit the minimum among the two-year period due to Reddit&rsquo;s participation in the Internet blackout in protest of SOPA. (Reddit&rsquo;s blackout was only from 8AM to 8PM EST, which is why there are a nonzero number of submissions for that day).</p></li>
<li><p>On April 1st, 2013, the daily number of Reddit submissions hit the maximum among the two-year period due to April Fool&rsquo;s Day, and the numerous amount of submissions for <em>X</em> brand/website&rsquo;s well-timed joke. However, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why there&rsquo;s a spike for April Fool&rsquo;s Day in 2013, but not April Fool&rsquo;s Day in 2012.</p></li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/subreddit-size/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-01T07:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/11/subreddit-size</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit&rsquo;s</a> subreddits cover, quite literally, an infinite amount of different topics. But which of its subreddits are the biggest?</p>

<p>Sure, Reddit is known for subreddits such as /r/pics and /r/aww, but in actuality, many of the lesser-known subreddits are much bigger than you think.</p>

<p>By tabulating the data of 37,561,369 total sitewide Link submissions, from 12/18/2011 to 9/26/2013, I created a tree map of the Top 100 subreddits by the number of Link submissions to that subreddit.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/subreddit-treemap.png" title="" ></p>

<p>In the tree map, the size of the rectangle and the saturation of the blue color indicate the relative size of the subreddit.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2013/07/new-default-subreddits-omgomgomg.html">default subreddits</a>, which all new users are subscribed to, are ranked mostly at the top. However, subreddits such as /r/POLITICO, /r/leagueoflegends, and /r/trees are higher (no pun intended) than most of the default subreddits.</p>

<p>And then you have the meta subreddits such as /r/ModerationLog and /r/reportthespammers, showing that people spend a considerable amount of time talking about Reddit itself.</p>

<p>Gaming has a very significant presence as well, with /r/Minecraft, /r/DotA2, and /r/tf2. (notably for the latter two, the trading subreddits for the respective games have significantly more link submissions than the subreddits themselves.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth nothing that these Top 100 subreddits only account for <strong>46.3% of all Reddit link submissions</strong>. Even the Top 500 subreddits only account for 66.2% of all Reddit submissions. The density of link submissions clearly follows a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long-tail</a> distribution, where most of the content is centralized from the top subreddits. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if Reddit is able to utilize that treasure trove of links in the future.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/10/wrds-and-vwls/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-14T07:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/10/wrds-and-vwls</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One reason startups use crazy and bizarre names like <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/12/totally-real-totally-serious/">NegaCycl</a> and <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/12/powerpoint-promo-party/">Filtrzzz</a> is to ensure that their name is unique, making it easier to acquire the .com domain name and Twitter handle for their startup. Another reason is to make their startup sound <em>kewl</em> and theoretically make the name more memorable in the minds of users and potential investors.</p>

<p>Dakwak, Wibki, Zeef, Funifi. These aren&rsquo;t random words: these are funded startups which were featured at <a href="http://startupalley.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Alley 2013</a>. And then you have startups such as Lyft, SCVNGR, and Fastly, which have all raised <em>tens of millions of dollars</em> in venture capital.</p>

<p>Do startups with these short, low-vowel names actually raise more money than startups with traditional names?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the association between the length of words in the English language and the number of vowels that they contain:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/english-words.png" width="600" height="600"></p>

<p>In the English language, the majority of the words have 8 letters, with 3 of those letters being vowels. (8,3) is also the center of the density distribution for the heat map, spreading outward.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the vowel distribution of normal English words to the distribution of the names of startups that have successfully raised venture capital, in order to identify just how many funded startups have quirky names:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/count-startups.png" width="600" height="600"></p>

<p>Wait, the two distributions are nearly identical! Both graphs are centered at about (8,3), radiating outward. This implies that the number of startups with uniquely-constructed names are outliers and not the typical names for startups.</p>

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t answer the core question: sure, fewer funded startups have weird names relative to the amount of total funded startups, but do they raise more money on average than startups with typical names?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/mean-startups-fund.png" width="600" height="600"></p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>There is no discernible pattern for the average amount raised, unlike with the previous two charts. For the vast majority of the possible combinations of name length and $ vowels, the range of capital raised is between $5M and $25M. There are higher values at the lower-end of the graph (low length, low vowels), but that can be attributed to the relatively low amount of startup data for those combinations to smooth out the average. (e.g. the $78M spike at 3 length, 2 vowels is due to the always-lovely <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/aol">AOL</a> and a <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2005/12/time-warners-aol-and-google-to-expand_20.html">$1 billion investment from Google</a>, and there are only 15 other startups in the segment.)</p>

<p>In fact, the statistical correlation between name length and funding, number of vowels and funding, and ratio of length to vowels and funding, are all effectively <strong>zero</strong>.</p>

<p>Sure, quirky startup names may make it easier to find a domain name, but it won&rsquo;t necessarily give an edge in the investment process.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/09/reddit-imgur-youtube/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-29T10:30:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/09/reddit-imgur-youtube</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, you may have noticed that many link submissions go to &ldquo;imgur.com&rdquo;. <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>, an image hosting service that launched on Reddit a few years ago and has seen outstanding growth ever since, even <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/26/imgur-traffic-milestone-100m-uniques/">surpassing Reddit itself</a>.</p>

<p>But how many of Reddit&rsquo;s many, many links are actually links to Imgur? As it turns out, Imgur, along with YouTube, account for <em>32%</em> of the links submitted to Reddit.</p>

<p>Using Reddit&rsquo;s API, I have downloaded about 5 million link submissions from Reddit, accounting for nearly two months of activity from July 22nd to September 26th. I complied a list of the most-frequent link destination domains for the links submitted anywhere on Reddit. The results were interesting.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/links722_926.png"></p>

<p>The imgur domains (i.imgur.com and imgur.com) account for <strong>23.7%</strong> of all links submitted to Reddit, and the YouTube domains (youtube.com and youtu.be) account for <strong>8.2%</strong> of all links.</p>

<p>Two websites account for <strong>32%</strong> of all links submitted to Reddit (i.e. 1 in every 3 submitted links go to Imgur or YouTube), and no other website is remotely close. Not the meme sites, not the music sites, not the news sites, not the <em>porn</em> sites: Reddit is images and video.</p>

<p>But <em>where</em> on Reddit are the Imgur and YouTube links most prominent?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart of the top subreddits, by percentage of all  Imgur links submitted on Reddit:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/imgur722_926.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note how the <em>funny</em> subreddit has more Imgur links than the <em>pics</em> subreddit.</p>

<p>For YouTube, and the percentage of all YouTube links submitted on Reddit by subreddit:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/youtube722_926.png"></p>

<p><em>Videos</em> wins as you might expect, but <em>Music</em> is in second place. Along with <em>listentothis</em>,
<em>Metal</em>, and <em>hiphopheads</em>, YouTube is the de facto website for <em>music</em> as well as video. Gaming is also  very popular with YouTube links, with <em>gaming</em>, <em>leagueoflegends</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

<p>Images and video are the backbone of Reddit, and both Imgur and YouTube are the primary sources. Although, there appears to be a nontrivial demand for pure music websites such as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> and gaming video websites such as <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a> &hellip;could there be another big success story in the making?</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/alma-mater-data/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-20T10:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/alma-mater-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you read startup funding announcements on tech blogs frequently, you&rsquo;ve may have noticed that these startup founders have often attended prestigious universities. Founders who have graduated from Ivy League schools, such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton, unsurprisingly raise millions for their startups. Of course, top tier tech schools such as Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon foster a strong technical and entrepreneurial background: attributes which venture capitalists seek when investing in a startup founder. <em>(Disclosure: I&rsquo;m a Carnegie Mellon alumnus)</em></p>

<p>Do the tech universities produce more funded graduates than the Ivy League universities? Do the founders from Ivy League Universities receive more funding than those from the top tier tech universities?</p>

<p>Using TechCrunch&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase</a> API, I obtained the data of about 2,500 startup founders in the United States who have created a startup which has received investment from venture capitalists.</p>

<p>With that data, I found some rather interesting trends.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Which universities produced the most amount of graduates who have received funding?</h1>

<p>Thousands of university graduates attempt to make a startup, but most will not succeed. Are the graduates of some universities more frequently successful?</p>

<p>Here are the Top 16 universities with the most number of successfully-funded graduates:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/founder-colleges.png"></p>

<p>Stanford has the most amount of funded graduates, which is unsurprising as it&rsquo;s located in the Silicon Valley heart of venture capital.</p>

<p>Seven out of the eight Ivy League Universities (colored green on the chart) are present, but most of the Ivies are  in the middle of the chart. MIT and UC Berkeley each have nearly <em>double</em> the amount of successful graduates from Yale and Columbia.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Tel Aviv University, an Israeli university, ties Duke University at 21.</p>

<h1>Which university&rsquo;s graduates have cumulatively raised the most amount of total funding?</h1>

<p>Another way to measure success is through the success of the founders&#8217; subsequent startups and the amount of venture capital they have raised.</p>

<p>Here are the Top 8 universities whose graduates have received the most amount of funding:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/sum-funding.png"></p>

<p>Harvard and Stanford graduates are very close in terms of total funding raised. However, there&rsquo;s a clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">Power Law</a> in effect, as those two along with UC Berkeley, have  produced founders who&rsquo;ve generated much, much more venture funding than those of the other universities.</p>

<h1>Which university&rsquo;s graduates raise the most amount of money in their first round of funding on average?</h1>

<p>Startup founders with big, world changing ideas need lots of venture capital. Only the founders with <em>good</em> ideas will actually receive it.</p>

<p>Here are the average amount of first-round funding for the top 16 universities with the most number of successfully-funded graduates:</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/avg-first-raised.png"></p>

<p>Carnegie Mellon and Princeton, which had a relatively low number of funded founders and a relatively low number of total capital raised, instead have a <em>significantly</em> higher amount of average first funding. UCLA also placed. Perhaps the students from these three universities tend to have more ambitious startup ideas?</p>

<p>At first glance, Stanford and Harvard appear to be the kings of startups. They have the most amount of graduates, and the most amount of total venture capital raised. The tech blogs would surely consider that a success, but could the greater funding for CMU/Princeton lead to the creation of the next billion-dollar startup? We can only wait and see.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE: As pointed out by robotcookies on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6075862">corresponding Hacker News thread</a>, I missed UCLA in the first draft, which had 29 funded graduates. The charts have been updated.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>You are welcome to use the founder data from CrunchBase by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjPFdCURhZvddEV1LUpaQUVsdmJYcERoM0FNU3lPcVE&amp;usp=sharing">viewing the data on Google Drive</a>, or by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jz2wsr4d6fc4t6/founders_w_college.csv">downloading the raw CSV</a>.</p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>University data was standardized to make analysis easier (e.g. for Carnegie Mellon, the founders who listed their institution as &ldquo;Carnegie Mellon University&rdquo;, &ldquo;Carnegie Mellon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;CMU,&rdquo; all had their institution changed to be &ldquo;CMU&rdquo;.)</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #1 measures unique founders, so it does not double-count a founder who has founded more than one  funded startup.</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #2 assumes equal contribution of each founder to the funding: if a startup has a total funding of $100,000 with 2 founders, the amount used for the chart will be $50,000 for each founder.</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #3 ignores startup data for the chart which has a Series B, Series C, or Series D listed as their first round on CrunchBase, or if the amount raised was not provided.</em></li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A Statistical Analysis of Medium.com Submissions to Hacker News]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/medium-normal/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-02T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/medium-normal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, a relatively new startup by Twitter cofounder Evan Williams, is a blog network that emphasizes simplicity and quality above everything else. Writers on the invite-only platform typically post stories about deeply personal topics, such as fighting adversity, never giving up your dreams, changing flawed systems, and other things that make the readers feel happy. One of my favorite articles on Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/editors-picks/57a0128b53c9">Choosing Minecraft Over Disney</a>, describe how a parent&rsquo;s children chose technology over television.</p>

<p>As of recently, the frequency of links to Medium posts on the popular tech-oriented link aggregator <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> has been increasing at an alarming rate. Since Medium&rsquo;s tales of triumph appeal to the ambitious entrepreneurs and startup founders of HN, the submissions are usually rapidly upvoted and easily make the front page, with  muted text helpfully noting that the link goes to medium.com. As a result, there has been <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968593">cognitive</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5974209">dissonance</a> on Hacker News whether Medium has too strong a presence on the aggregator, or worse,  potentially gaming the system.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://www.hnsearch.com/api">HNSearch API</a>, I analyzed the submissions of links under the medium.com domain to Hacker News to see just how Medium keeps surging in popularity. The results, as always, are very revealing.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The collected data is a sample of 1,000 links (out of 1,355 total) submitted to Hacker News under the medium.com domain.  Each data point contains the Title of the article, the HN user who submitted it, the amount of upvotes it received, the time it was posted (in PST), and links to both the article and the HN comments thread for reference. You can view the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjPFdCURhZvddDBPNFlMQUYyX1FhUkVVY2g1TmVLM1E&amp;usp=sharing">data on Google Drive</a>, or download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xnktwi9kheyqf6v/medium.csv">the raw CSV</a> and play with the data yourself.</p>

<p>What does the data tell us about Medium?</p>

<hr />

<h1>How quickly has medium.com grown in popularity in the past few months?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-month.png"></p>

<p>Medium was launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/medium-obvious/">in August 2012</a>, and received relatively little attention as evidenced by the graph. But 8 months later, the frequency of medium.com submissions hockey-sticked, receiving almost 5x growth from March 2013 to April 2013. That certainly explains one of the reasons why the rise in medium.com links is just being noticed now.</p>

<hr />

<h1>When are medium.com posts being written and submitted to HN?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-by-hour.png"></p>

<p>The time of day a blog post is submitted makes all the difference in the world, especially if your blog platform targets readers in a specific region. Medium links are frequently posted and submitted around 10am PST / 1pm EST, which is smart as it&rsquo;s relatively early in the day for those living in the United States, and your potential readers would be more likely to read your post, and HN users are more likely to upvote.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Who are the Hacker News users who most frequently submit medium.com articles?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-top-submitters.png"></p>

<p>Of the 1,000 submissions, there were only 622 unique submitters of medium.com links, each submitting an average of 1.61 posts. Most only post their own articles, but others, like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=rpsubhub">rpsubhub</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=mrbird">mrbird</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=nvk">nvk</a> submit Medium.com links more often. However, none of those users appear to be associated with Medium; they just submit links rather frequently.</p>

<h1>What are the types of articles on medium.com submitted to Hacker News?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-wordcloud.png"></p>

<p>Medium&rsquo;s category system is somewhat obtuse, so I parsed the keywords from the titles of the submissions (using a method similar to <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/big-social-data/">my last post</a>) in order to get an idea what type of content is submitted most from Medium. There are lots of posts that ask rhetorical questions (<strong>What?</strong>, <strong>How?</strong>, <strong>Why?</strong>), and even more posts about the personal self with <strong>I</strong>. Not only is Medium using the right language to facilitate interaction, it&rsquo;s also hitting the interests of HNers with keywords such as <strong>Design</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong>.</p>

<h1>How successful <em>are</em> medium.com articles on Hacker News?</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/medium-front-page.png"></p>

<p>Out of the 1,000 submissions, only 158 had atleast 10 upvotes, which is enough to get the link to the front page, but not necessarily enough to keep it there. The graph is heavily right-skewed, with only 38 submissions getting above 100 points. It shows that medium.com links so not guarantee success, and even if you hit the front page, you have a low chance of hitting the coveted #1 ranking.</p>

<hr />

<p>Medium is definitely growing. HN is receiving more and more submissions which appeal to the average HN user, and posts are being submitted at all hours of the day. However, having a post at medium.com is not a panacea that will make your blog post be seen by thousands of people; you still need to write something interesting.</p>

<p>Time will tell. But if HN does indeed get bored of Medium, I believe the problem will correct itself.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Predicting the Number of Likes on a Facebook Status With Statistical Keyword Analysis]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/big-social-data/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-22T10:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/big-social-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What makes people click the Like button on Facebook Statuses? Does the status say something funny? Does it contain a cool link or a funny photo? Does the status actively engage its readers?</p>

<p>Needless to say, brands on Facebook want to know the answers to these questions. The more people that Like their statuses on their Facebook Pages, the more exposure they gain, and the more money they earn. Many, many companies have been created for the sole purpose of maximizing the number of Facebook Likes.</p>

<p>By 2013, most brands have realized that photo posts and statuses that ask a question <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/10/questions-equals-reponses/">will generate <em>much</em> higher numbers</a> of Likes. Personally, that&rsquo;s not why <em>I</em> like a given Facebook status: I Like statuses that contain new and exciting things that are relevant to my interests. The first thing I read in a status is the Message: if the message is boring and uninteresting, then there&rsquo;s no reason for me to Like the status needlessly.</p>

<p>Can the keywords and language in a Facebook Status predict the number of Likes the status receives?</p>

<p>Running multivariate regressions on keywords from thousands of Facebook statuses, I&rsquo;ve discovered that the language used in a status <em>does</em> help predict the number of Likes a status receives, and actually could help brands learn much more about their fans.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Setup</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/rdataset.png"></p>

<p>In order to draw accurate conclusions from the analysis, large amounts of data are needed (and there&rsquo;s no such thing as too much data).</p>

<p>I decided to analyze the Facebook Pages of 3 extremely popular News sources: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cnn">CNN</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nytimes">New York Times</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcworldnews">BBC World News</a>. All three Pages have millions of fans, post the same types of Facebook statuses, and post statuses extremely frequently to Facebook (around 8-9 times a day). The statuses analyzed will be from June 1st 2012 to June 1st 2013, in order to both gather a large sample size (~3,000  statuses from each Page) and a ensure a consistent apples-to-apples comparison between the three sources.</p>

<p>The raw data, code, and a detailed technical explanation of the statistical techniques used to process the data can be found in <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-keyword-regression-analysis">this GitHub repository</a>. (tl;dr, it&rsquo;s an optimized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least squares</a> regression)</p>

<p><em>Can the keywords and language in a Facebook Status predict the number of Likes the status receives?</em> We&rsquo;re ready to test this hypothesis.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<ul>
<li>The most impactful keywords for CNN are political keywords.</li>
<li><strong>NEWS</strong> (&ldquo;BREAKING NEWS&rdquo;) predicts more Likes than <strong>Photo</strong> (i.e. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/5550296508/posts/10151626042186509">Travel Photo of the Day</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Bourdain</strong> refers to Anthony Bourdain, who very recently began <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain:_Parts_Unknown">a food and travel show</a> on CNN. I assume that targets CNN&rsquo;s primary demographic.</li>
<li>The presence of <strong>Barack</strong> (Barack Obama) predicts more likes than just <strong>Obama</strong>.</li>
<li>The presence of <strong>Monday</strong> predicts more likes most other keywords. Garfield would be disappointed.</li>
<li>The presence of <strong>North</strong> (North Korea) predicts a <em>decrease</em> in Likes from the average. Is North Korea boring?</li>
<li>The presence of <strong>Check</strong> (&ldquo;Check this out!&rdquo;) also predicts a decrease in Likes from the average. This is interesting because this call-to-action is usually associated with the other keywords. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not necessary?</li>

<li><strong>You</strong> and <strong>See</strong> are impactful call-to-action keywords, even though they don&rsquo;t ask any questions. (Interestingly, <strong>Are</strong>, which implicitly asks a question, predicts a decrease in Likes. Maybe people don&rsquo;t Like questions?)</li>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<ul>
<li>The most impactful keywords for BBC World News are keywords describing news around the world. Unlike CNN and NYTimes, there are very few impactful keywords related to domestic politics (such as Prime Minister <strong>David</strong> Cameron, and even <strong>Barack</strong> is more impactful than him.)</li>
<li><strong>Malala</strong> refers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai">Malala Youdsfzai</a>, a Pakistani activist who survived an assassination attempt.</li>
<li>Implicit question keywords such as <strong>Let</strong>, <strong>Do</strong>, and <strong>Would</strong> are all very effective.</li>
<li>The simple salutation of <strong>Hi</strong> predicts a decrease in Likes. There&rsquo;s a British joke here somewhere.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>The language used in Facebook Statuses can be very useful in identifying what words Fans like, and what words will be most useful in generating the most exposure. While my analysis can&rsquo;t predict the <em>exact</em> number of Likes a Status receives, and I likely <a href="http://xkcd.com/882/">broke a few rules of statistics</a> in the process of making this post, the impact of language and specific keywords on social media interaction is an endeavor worth pursuing.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Facebook Hashtags Are Fundamentally Broken]]></title>
    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/hashtag-hashtag/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-14T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/hashtag-hashtag</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> added <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/633/Public-Conversations-on-Facebook">searchable hashtags</a> to all status updates and user comments. As with <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, whenever a Facebook user posts an status with a #hashtag, that hashtag becomes clickable and leads to a News Feed of all other publically-visible posts with that hashtag.</p>

<p>The implementation of hashtags in Facebook is an obvious move. Advertisements and television shows display hashtags all the time to encourage users to Tweet about them: it&rsquo;s free marketing, after all. Facebook can piggy-back off those already-existing hashtags and grow user adoption <em>very</em> quickly, especially with Facebook-owned <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> already supporting hashtags.</p>

<p>However, Facebook is a fundamentally different social network than Twitter. While Twitter uses hashtags to quickly categorize a feed of 140-character thoughts, Facebook&rsquo;s content feeds  typically consist of long posts and large images. Additionally, while posts on Twitter are explicitly public or private, Facebook&rsquo;s privacy settings are more granular: if users don&rsquo;t make their posts Public, the hashtag is essentially useless. And the brands are going to <em>love</em> hashtags. Maybe too much.</p>

<p>The magic of Facebook is flat-out incompatible with the magic of hashtags.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Too Long; Didn&rsquo;t Read</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/facebooktwitter.png"></p>

<p>Since Twitter posts have a length limit, they&rsquo;re short and occupy a consistent amount of space on the webpage. Facebook posts can be near-unlimited length, utilize a large amount of a white space between posts, and also potentially contain an equally-long comment section. As a result, 5 Twitter posts can use the same amount of screen real-estate as 2 Facebook posts. Given the already incredibly low signal-to-noise quality ratio of #hashtag feeds (as evident above), this makes reading hashtag feeds on Facebook a chore.</p>

<h2>A Thousand Words Takes A Lot Of Space</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/bieber-twitter.png"></p>

<p>Facebook displays pictures embedded in posts natively in the feed, while Twitter requires the user to click the Tweet to see the photo. In this case, the ratio of Twitter:Facebook posts can be even worse, in this case 6 Twitter posts for 1 Facebook post.</p>

<h2>If A Hashtag Isn&rsquo;t Seen, Was It Posted?</h2>

<p>Twitter is opt-in private posting. Facebook is opt-<em>out</em> private posting. That&rsquo;s a big usability problem.</p>

<p>The Facebook hashtag feeds only show posts that are explicitly  made Public (or posts from your Friends which are set to a privacy of Friends Only). If the user is unaware that their posts are not Public by default, then their posts containing the hashtag will never be seen and the user won&rsquo;t be able to participate in social hashtag feeds.  Although Facebook has made improvements in helping users set the intended privacy level of a post, it makes the process of posting much more deliberate and much less impulsive than Twitter.</p>

<h2>#brand #branding #marketing #yolo #swag</h2>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/hashtagabuse.png"></p>

<p>Brands love hashtags. The more hashtags included in a Tweet, the more exposure the Tweet receives, right?</p>

<p>With Twitter, there&rsquo;s a limit on the number of hashtags in a Tweet due to the delicate balance between the number of hashtags, the length of the hashtags, and the length of the Tweet itself. On Facebook, you can include <strong>25</strong> hashtags in any post!</p>

<p>Since there&rsquo;s no consequence for abusing hashtags, expect to see more Facebook brands taking advantage this new free source of marketing. Expect to see Facebook get much more cluttered.</p>

<h2>Explicit Image Bombing</h2>

<p>A malicious user could theoretically insert shock images into popular hashtag feeds. During my testing of Facebook hashtags, there was a surprising amount of nudity in the seemingly-innocuous #many hashtag.</p>

<p>On Twitter, the volume of Tweets is much higher and the images are hidden by default, so the odds of such an attack working on Facebook are much higher than on Twitter.</p>

<h2>Comment Hashtags Different From Post Hashtags</h2>

<p>You can hashtag comments on Facebook posts like you can hashtag Facebook posts themselves. But hashtagged comments won&rsquo;t appear in the hashtag News Feed. Whereas on Twitter, Replies are also Tweets and can be hashtagged accordingly. This behavior isn&rsquo;t surprising, but it&rsquo;s still a big inconsistency.</p>

<hr />

<p>Will Facebook Hashtags fail due to the massive differences between Facebook and Twitter? It&rsquo;s hard to say, but I&rsquo;m skeptical that Facebook will be able to capture the hashtag magic.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-05T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/working-as-intended</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many legitimate reasons for users to uninstall programs on their computer, such as freeing hard-disk space and lowering CPU overhead. A decade ago, when excessive hard-drive space was a luxury, avid PC gamers would frequently uninstall large, multi-gigabyte games that they were no longer playing in order to make space for new games.</p>

<p>Obviously, developers would prefer that their users not uninstall the software that they spent years creating.  Regardless, developers should ensure that the uninstall process works properly.</p>

<p>Otherwise, a poorly coded PC game uninstaller could delete not just the game, but the <em>entire hard drive</em>. That would be a problem.</p>

<p><span class="pull-right" style="padding: 20px"><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/1999/01/06"><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/pennyarcademyth2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>

<p>In late 1998, Bungie (which would later create the <a href="http://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/">Halo</a> series) released <a href="http://mythipedia.wikia.com/wiki/Myth_II:_Soulblighter">Myth II: Soulblighter</a> for Windows. Myth II, a real-time tactics game, was received with great reception and highly-positive reviews.</p>

<p>But before the worldwide release, a Bungie employee <a href="http://halo.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=juggernougat">uninstalled version 1.0</a> of Myth II, and afterwards, her PC refused to reboot:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was discovered by a very nice young lady in a Japanese office as she worked on the Asian versions of Myth – just as she was trying out the final build. She attempted to uninstall it from the main root folder of her hard drive – not brilliant, but pretty common practice – and perfectly fine for most games. The game proceeded to eat her hard drive like a fresh Bento Box.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Myth II Uninstaller worked by deleting the folder which contained the game files. However, this implementation assumed that the user installed Myth II in the default directory. (i.e. C:\Program Files\Myth II). If the user installed Myth II in a <em>different</em> directory, such as the <em>system root C:\</em>, then when the user uninstalled the game, <strong>all the files in the C drive were deleted.</strong> Boom.</p>

<p>As Bungie later explained <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/news/98/december/981229/bungierecall.html">in a press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In certain unusual cases, using the Uninstaller can cause problems. If a user chooses an installation directory other than the default directory, they should NOT use the Uninstaller but should manually drag the Myth II folder into the Recycle bin and delete it.</p>

<p>Anyone who has the game but has not yet installed it is asked to wait for a new version of the Installer which we will release shortly. If you have already installed the game, there is no harm in playing it, but players should be careful not to use the Uninstall executable. If you have already Uninstalled and not experienced obvious problems, there is nothing to worry about.</p></blockquote>

<p>Calling the potential obliteration of an operating system a &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is an understatement.</p>

<p>Although the issue was not widespread, Bungie decided to do a recall of all Myth II CDs and redistribute a version 1.1, eliminating most of the game&rsquo;s profits in the process.</p>

<p>You could say that the Myth II version 1.0 uninstaller worked exactly as intended: it did indeed uninstall the game. It just worked <em>too</em> well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/">Guild Wars 2</a> is an incredible massively-multiplayer online role-playing game. The goal of Guild Wars 2, developed by ArenaNet, is to save the world, complete quests, and get awesome loot; objectives similar to that of many other MMORPGs such as <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">World of Warcraft</a>. However, Guild Wars 2 differentiates itself from its spiritual predecessors with its dynamically-changing world, incredible graphics, and the elimination of annoying and tedious time-wasters that have plagued the MMORPG genre.</p>

<p>The best items in Guild Wars 2, naturally, require a large amount of effort and money to obtain. In order to create Legendary weapons, players must obtain large amounts of an item known as Globs of Ectoplasm. Globs of Ectoplasm (abbreviated as &ldquo;Ecto&rdquo;) are obtained randomly when a player salvages a Rare item using a Salvage Kit. Due to their high demand, Ecto effectively serve as a second currency in Guild Wars 2.</p>

<p>Using the best Salvage Kit (that doesn&rsquo;t require paying real-world money), players received, on average, 0.9 Ecto per Rare Item Salvage, a value that has been well-documented and well-tested. But after a patch released a couple days ago, <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/first">players on the Official Guild Wars 2 forums</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1fc540/ecto_salvage_rate_bug_being_looked_into_keep_your/">Reddit</a> began to notice that the drop rate for Ecto was <em>much</em> lower, with no mention in the patch notes.</p>

<p>How do you <em>prove</em> something that occurs at random now occurs less frequently?</p>

<h1>What is &ldquo;Random&rdquo;?</h1>

<p>The first rule of any official MMO forum: never accuse the developers of making implicit changes to the game unless you have proof. Such tactics are commonly employed by forum trolls and it makes building a community more difficult.</p>

<p>The second rule of any official MMO forum: never accuse the developers of manipulating probability. As with normal gambling, players can hit a streak of bad luck with loot drops, enemy critical attacks, etc. But the anecdotal data from one player is not sufficient proof of any probability change. (an <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Why_does_Onyxia_cast_Deep_Breath%3F">old meme</a> from the World of Warcraft era mocked the userbase&rsquo;s inability to comprehend the definition of random)</p>

<p>On May 28th, a player <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/first">noted on the official GW2 forums</a> that out of 166 salvages, he only received about 80 Ecto, or about 0.5 Ecto/Salvage. This is approximately <em>half</em> of the original rate of 0.9 Ecto/Salvage. Since the rate of new Ecto entering the market was halved with no change in demand, the Auction House <a href="http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/19721">price for Ecto</a> began to steadily rise.</p>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/gw2ecto.png"></p>

<p>The price increase in the short-term was not <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/05/stones-of-jordan/">economy-breaking</a>, but when you need 250 Ectos to create a Legendary weapon in the long-term, it can add up very quickly.</p>

<p>Other players provided their experiences in the thread, with limited results such as &ldquo;noticed this too, yesterday i salvaged 9 rares, got 4 ectos&rdquo; and &ldquo;20 rare at the end of my day, i save them before go bed: 0 ecto. wtf?&rdquo;. Such sample sizes are much too low to satisfy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a> and draw any remotely accurate conclusions.</p>

<p>Regina Buenaobra, ArenaNet Community Manager, eventually <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/page/3#post2115818">responded</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Changes to important things like salvage rates would be listed in the update notes if they have changed. If it’s not in the update notes, then no changes have been made by the development team.</p></blockquote>

<p>So Word of God implies that everyone is wrong. Issue over?</p>

<p>Of course not!</p>

<h1>No Such Thing As Too Much Data</h1>

<p>Despite Regina&rsquo;s dismissal, players continued to post in the thread and began quoting even larger sample sizes, such as a <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/2114853">salvaging 500 Rares</a> resulting in 286 Ectos (0.57 Ecto/Salvage) and <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/page/3#post2116461">salvaging 775 Rares</a> resulting in 402 Ecto (0.52 Ecto/Salvage). With those sample sizes, the probability that the true salvage rate is unchanged from 0.9 Ecto/Salvage is essentially zero.</p>

<p>John Smith, ArenaNet&rsquo;s resident economist, <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/page/4#post2116752">replied</a> that he&rsquo;ll &ldquo;look into this and get back to you.&rdquo; A day later, John made a <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/2122262">promise</a> that &ldquo;if we change anything involving ectos, there will be public information on it.&rdquo; Sure enough, on May 30th, a new patch was released with only <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/info/news/Game-Update-Notes-May-28-2013/2124609">one patch note</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fixed a salvaging bug introduced in the last patch that sometimes caused salvage kits to yield incorrect results.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that was that, the price of Ecto almost immediately dropped. All was well.</p>

<p>John left one final <a href="https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/gw2/Changes-to-ecto-salvage-from-rares/2124684">message</a>: &ldquo;Thanks to everyone for your help identifying the issue and providing great data for me to start with in my research.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="pull-right" src="http://minimaxir.com/img/GoldenSun.png"></p>

<p>When the Game Boy Advance was released in June 2001, Nintendo promised that the handheld device would be capable of delivering a home gaming console experience on-the-go. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun">Golden Sun</a>, developed by Camelot and published by Nintendo a few months after the console&rsquo;s release, exemplified the GBA&rsquo;s full capabilities with its hand-drawn environments, flashy battle effects, and <em>very</em> difficult dungeon puzzles which undoubtedly resulted in the sale of many strategy guides.</p>

<p>In Golden Sun, you play as a group of teenage mages called Adepts, who wield the power of the four elements (Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water) by casting spells with Psynergy. The antagonists of the game are a pair of jerks who are attempting to reawaken a dangerous and sealed power, and only four kids can stop them from destroying the world. Released two years later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sun:_The_Lost_Age">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a> takes place immediately after the conclusion of the first game with a different quartet of Adepts and a new pair of jerks. In this sequel, it is revealed that the jerks who keep trying to kill you are not the bad guys and the whole conflict is just one big misunderstanding! Yes, the plot is very reminiscent of other Japanese-developed RPGs such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_(video_game)">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, but it&rsquo;s still impressive for a game I typically played in the backseat of a car.</p>

<p>Like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger, Golden Sun has an inventory system where players earn new weapons and items by purchasing them at a store or by finding them as loot from defeating enemies in the world. The most powerful weapons, naturally, only drop from enemies at the end of the game with odds of less than 0.01% per kill. If you killed <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binomial+distribution%28100%2C1%2F256%29">such enemies 100 times</a>, for example, you would only have a 32% expected chance of seeing a rare drop among all the kills. And killing that many enemies could take hours. It depends on the almighty will of Golden Sun&rsquo;s Random Number Generator.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Random_Number_Generator">Golden Sun RNG</a> is so poorly implemented that players have found out how to make events with 1/256 probability occur <em>one hundred percent</em> of the time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>You Make Your Own Luck</h1>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/221/"><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/random_number.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Soon after the first Golden Sun was released, players discovered that the first random enemy encounter the player enters after turning the GBA on was always a First Strike, where the player&rsquo;s party gets a free turn. Was this a cute gameplay mechanic intended to give the player a quick advantage, or was it indicative of a flaw in the game&rsquo;s RNG?</p>

<p>Most modern RNGs are partially seeded and randomized using a timer, i.e. the current time of the computer in microseconds. This makes it infeasable to reproduce the output of the RNG reliably.</p>

<p>However, the GBA does not have an internal clock, so time-based methods of seeding aren&rsquo;t possible. By the time the sequel was released in 2003, the
<a href="http://www.goldensunrealm.com/gs/nickpresta_rng-guide.txt">entire Golden Sun RNG</a> was reverse-engineered:</p>

<blockquote><p>Golden Sun uses the ANSI-C standard rand function as its Pseudo-Random Number
Generator.</p>

<p>There is one difference: Golden Sun&rsquo;s RNG uses an unsigned 4-byte number and
returns it with no shifting, so you&rsquo;d replace &ldquo;return ((next >>16) &amp; 32757);&rdquo;
with &ldquo;return (next &amp; 4294967295);&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, ordinarily, is a perfectly capable RNG, but there is one flaw with what
Golden Sun does with it.</p>

<p>It only makes a new random number when something random happens. What&rsquo;s more,
it uses <em>two</em> copies of the RNG to create two random numbers, and the
first RNG only handles battle situations.</p>

<p>As such, it is easy to control when a new random number is generated.</p>

<p>On top of this, the RNGs are seeded with 0 when the GBA is reset, and because
of the way the game has been programmed, the RNG controlling battle events will
<em>continue</em> to be 0 even when you load the game&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Golden Sun&rsquo;s Random Number Generator isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;random&rdquo; at all. It&rsquo;s manipulated <em>entirely</em> from player-controlled actions, from the moment the Game Boy Advance is turned on.</p>

<h1>Get Lucky</h1>

<p><img src="http://minimaxir.com/img/kiku.png"></p>

<p>One of Golden Sun&rsquo;s contributions to the typical RPG character class customization is the <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Djinn">Djinn system</a>. In the game lore, Djinn are impish creatures that grant enhanced powers to Adepts. There are four types of Djinn, one for each element, that can be found in the overworld, and each Djinni can be used to either increase a character&rsquo;s statistics, or Unleashed to provide a powerful spell effect. Also, as with many other RPGs, Golden Sun implements an elemental rock-paper-scissors combat system: enemies are weak to an element and resistant to another.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">GameFAQs</a> forum user by the name of &ldquo;darkpanther&rdquo; discovered that using a Djinn Unleash with an element that is the enemy&rsquo;s weakness will not only increase the amount of Experience and Coins earned, but also <em>quadruple</em> the chance of the enemy dropping a rare item. (this fact is neither hinted anywhere in the game nor stated in any strategy guides)</p>

<p>This is essential toward manipulating the RNG. Normally, the rarest items such as <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Tisiphone_Edge">Tisiphone Edge</a> and <a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Lachesis%27_Rule">Lachesis&#8217; Rule</a> have an &ldquo;Item-Class Chance&rdquo; of 9, meaning the item has a 1/(2<sup>9-1</sup>) = 1/256 chance of dropping per enemy kill. The &ldquo;DP Method&rdquo; decreases the ICC by 2, meaning the new drop rate becomes 1/(2<sup>7-1</sup>) = 1/64. But:</p>

<blockquote><p>As &lsquo;unpredictable&rsquo; as RNGs seem to be, if they are always seeded to the same
value and do not use a timer-based response, they will become predictable by
anyone who is good at noticing patterns. One pattern being, for example, that
the 31st random number that is calculated &ndash; 33727075 &ndash; will drop <em>any</em> item if
the enemy dying when this random number was called was just killed by an
elemental Djinn attack that it is weak to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Calculating the 31st random number would fail against an ICC9 item, but now works against an ICC7 item. (and all items of lower ICC too)</p>

<p>Therefore, <strong>in order to guarantee that an item drops, kill the appropriate enemy with an element-advantage Djinni such that the 30th random number is generated</strong>. (the 31st random number is generated on the enemy&rsquo;s death)</p>

<p>How do you ensure that you only create 31 random numbers? From the Golden Sun Wikia:</p>

<blockquote><p>Save the game and do a hard reset in the area where the monster that drops the item you need appears. Run around to get in a battle. If the encounter consists of a formation of 2 monsters, with at least one of them being the monster you want, proceed. If not, do another hard reset and try again.</p>

<p>During battle, have the entire party use multi-targetting Psynergy on the targets in the first turn, and since a battle right after a hard reset always involve your party attacking first where possible, the monsters will not be able to act. During the second turn, use two multi-targetting Psynergy on the enemies, and have the third party member (or fourth, if one of the three party members that act before uses Defend) unleash an attack Djinni of the element the monster is weak to on the monster. If by this point, the monster flashes in colour and dies, you will obtain the drop of that monster at the end of the battle, however rare it is. If the monster does not die then (either dies too soon or doesn&rsquo;t die by this step), adjust the power of your attacks until you get it just right.</p></blockquote>

<p>Moral of story: if you&rsquo;re making a video game, seed your RNGs with an algorithm that players can&rsquo;t manipulate 100%. Otherwise, hilarity will inevitably ensue. I forgive Camelot for implementing a simplistic RNG though; the two games&#8217; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaxYYwMqiso&amp;list=PL8C84ECF55B28DC74">awesome</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M31afGXIGpQ&amp;list=PL586792F46D5A35D4&amp;index=13">soundtrack </a> more than makes up for it.</p>
