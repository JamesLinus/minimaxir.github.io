    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you read startup funding announcements on tech blogs frequently, you&rsquo;ve may have noticed that these startup founders have often attended prestigious universities. Founders who have graduated from Ivy League schools, such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton, unsurprisingly raise millions for their startups. Of course, top tier tech schools such as Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon foster a strong technical and entrepreneurial background: attributes which venture capitalists seek when investing in a startup founder. <em>(Disclosure: I&rsquo;m a Carnegie Mellon alumnus)</em></p>

<p>Do the tech universities produce more funded graduates than the Ivy League universities? Do the founders from Ivy League Universities receive more funding than those from the top tier tech universities?</p>

<p>Using TechCrunch&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase</a> API, I obtained the data of about 2,500 startup founders in the United States who have created a startup which has received investment from venture capitalists.</p>

<p>With that data, I found some rather interesting trends.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Which universities produced the most amount of graduates who have received funding?</h1>

<p>Thousands of university graduates attempt to make a startup, but most will not succeed. Are the graduates of some universities more frequently successful?</p>

<p>Here are the Top 15 universities with the most number of successfully-funded graduates:</p>

<p><img src="/img/founder-colleges.png"></p>

<p>Stanford has the most amount of funded graduates, which is unsurprising as it&rsquo;s located in the Silicon Valley heart of venture capital.</p>

<p>Seven out of the eight Ivy League Universities (colored green on the chart) are present, but most of the Ivies are  in the middle of the chart. MIT and UC Berkeley each have nearly <em>double</em> the amount of successful graduates from Yale and Columbia.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Tel Aviv University, an Israeli university, is present on the chart.</p>

<h1>Which university&rsquo;s graduates have cumulatively raised the most amount of total funding?</h1>

<p>Another way to measure success is through the success of the founders' subsequent startups and the amount of venture capital they have raised.</p>

<p>Here are the Top 8 universities whose graduates have received the most amount of funding:</p>

<p><img src="/img/sum-funding.png"></p>

<p>Harvard and Stanford graduates are very close in terms of total funding raised. However, there&rsquo;s a clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">Power Law</a> in effect, as those two along with UC Berkeley, have  produced founders who&rsquo;ve generated much, much more venture funding than those of the other universities.</p>

<h1>Which university&rsquo;s graduates raise the most amount of money in their first round of funding on average?</h1>

<p>Startup founders with big, world changing ideas need lots of venture capital. Only the founders with <em>good</em> ideas will actually receive it.</p>

<p>Here are the average amount of first-round funding for the top 15 universities with the most number of successfully-funded graduates:</p>

<p><img src="/img/avg-first-raised.png"></p>

<p>Carnegie Mellon and Princeton, which had a relatively low number of funded founders and a relatively low number of total capital raised, instead have a <em>significantly</em> higher amount of average first funding. Tel Aviv University also placed higher than almost all US colleges. Perhaps the students from these three universities tend to have more ambitious startup ideas?</p>

<p>At first glance, Stanford and Harvard appear to be the kings of startups. They have the most amount of graduates, and the most amount of total venture capital raised. The tech blogs would surely consider that a success, but could the greater funding for CMU/Princeton lead to the creation of the next billion-dollar startup? We can only wait and see.</p>

<hr />

<p>You are welcome to use the founder data from CrunchBase by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjPFdCURhZvddEV1LUpaQUVsdmJYcERoM0FNU3lPcVE&amp;usp=sharing">viewing the data on Google Drive</a>, or by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jz2wsr4d6fc4t6/founders_w_college.csv">downloading the raw CSV</a>.</p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>University data was standardized to make analysis easier (e.g. for Carnegie Mellon, the founders who listed their institution as &ldquo;Carnegie Mellon University&rdquo;, &ldquo;Carnegie Mellon,&rdquo; and &ldquo;CMU,&rdquo; all had their institution changed to be &ldquo;CMU&rdquo;.)</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #1 measures unique founders, so it does not double-count a founder who has founded more than one  funded startup.</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #2 assumes equal contribution of each founder to the funding: if a startup has a total funding of $100,000 with 2 founders, the amount used for the chart will be $50,000 for each founder.</em></li>
<li><em>Chart #3 ignores startup data for the chart which has a Series B, Series C, or Series D listed as their first round on CrunchBase, or if the amount raised was not provided.</em></li>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/medium-normal/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-02T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/07/medium-normal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, a relatively new startup by Twitter cofounder Evan Williams, is a blog network that emphasizes simplicity and quality above everything else. Writers on the invite-only platform typically post stories about deeply personal topics, such as fighting adversity, never giving up your dreams, changing flawed systems, and other things that make the readers feel happy. One of my favorite articles on Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/editors-picks/57a0128b53c9">Choosing Minecraft Over Disney</a>, describe how a parent&rsquo;s children chose technology over television.</p>

<p>As of recently, the frequency of links to Medium posts on the popular tech-oriented link aggregator <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> has been increasing at an alarming rate. Since Medium&rsquo;s tales of triumph appeal to the ambitious entrepreneurs and startup founders of HN, the submissions are usually rapidly upvoted and easily make the front page, with  muted text helpfully noting that the link goes to medium.com. As a result, there has been <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968593">cognitive</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5974209">dissonance</a> on Hacker News whether Medium has too strong a presence on the aggregator, or worse,  potentially gaming the system.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://www.hnsearch.com/api">HNSearch API</a>, I analyzed the submissions of links under the medium.com domain to Hacker News to see just how Medium keeps surging in popularity. The results, as always, are very revealing.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The collected data is a sample of 1,000 links (out of 1,355 total) submitted to Hacker News under the medium.com domain.  Each data point contains the Title of the article, the HN user who submitted it, the amount of upvotes it received, the time it was posted (in PST), and links to both the article and the HN comments thread for reference. You can view the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjPFdCURhZvddDBPNFlMQUYyX1FhUkVVY2g1TmVLM1E&amp;usp=sharing">data on Google Drive</a>, or download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xnktwi9kheyqf6v/medium.csv">the raw CSV</a> and play with the data yourself.</p>

<p>What does the data tell us about Medium?</p>

<hr />

<h1>How quickly has medium.com grown in popularity in the past few months?</h1>

<p><img src="/img/medium-month.png"></p>

<p>Medium was launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/medium-obvious/">in August 2012</a>, and received relatively little attention as evidenced by the graph. But 8 months later, the frequency of medium.com submissions hockey-sticked, receiving almost 5x growth from March 2013 to April 2013. That certainly explains one of the reasons why the rise in medium.com links is just being noticed now.</p>

<hr />

<h1>When are medium.com posts being written and submitted to HN?</h1>

<p><img src="/img/medium-by-hour.png"></p>

<p>The time of day a blog post is submitted makes all the difference in the world, especially if your blog platform targets readers in a specific region. Medium links are frequently posted and submitted around 10am PST / 1pm EST, which is smart as it&rsquo;s relatively early in the day for those living in the United States, and your potential readers would be more likely to read your post, and HN users are more likely to upvote.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Who are the Hacker News users who most frequently submit medium.com articles?</h1>

<p><img src="/img/medium-top-submitters.png"></p>

<p>Of the 1,000 submissions, there were only 622 unique submitters of medium.com links, each submitting an average of 1.61 posts. Most only post their own articles, but others, like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=rpsubhub">rpsubhub</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=mrbird">mrbird</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=nvk">nvk</a> submit Medium.com links more often. However, none of those users appear to be associated with Medium; they just submit links rather frequently.</p>

<hr />

<h1>What are the types of articles on medium.com submitted to Hacker News?</h1>

<p><img src="/img/medium-wordcloud.png"></p>

<p>Medium&rsquo;s category system is somewhat obtuse, so I parsed the keywords from the titles of the submissions (using a method similar to <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/06/big-social-data/">my last post</a>) in order to get an idea what type of content is submitted most from Medium. There are lots of posts that ask rhetorical questions (<strong>What?</strong>, <strong>How?</strong>, <strong>Why?</strong>), and even more posts about the personal self with <strong>I</strong>. Not only is Medium using the right language to facilitate interaction, it&rsquo;s also hitting the interests of HNers with keywords such as <strong>Design</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h1>How successful <em>are</em> medium.com articles on Hacker News?</h1>

<p><img src="/img/medium-front-page.png"></p>

<p>Out of the 1,000 submissions, only 158 had atleast 10 upvotes, which is enough to get the link to the front page, but not necessarily enough to keep it there. The graph is heavily right-skewed, with only 38 submissions getting above 100 points. It shows that medium.com links so not guarantee success, and even if you hit the front page, you have a low chance of hitting the coveted #1 ranking.</p>

<hr />

<p>Medium is definitely growing. HN is receiving more and more submissions which appeal to the average HN user, and posts are being submitted at all hours of the day. However, having a post at medium.com is not a panacea that will make your blog post be seen by thousands of people; you still need to write something interesting.</p>

<p>Time will tell. But if HN does indeed get bored of Medium, I believe the problem will correct itself.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/05/overly-attached-startup/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-13T18:51:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/05/overly-attached-startup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago, my best friend wanted to make a personal website. After talking with her about what types of features she wanted (home page, photo galleries, low price, etc.) I recommended that she use a website-building platform with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor, such as <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> or <a href="http://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a>. I had heard good things about both websites, especially Weebly, a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/01/15/weebly-goes-with-ycombinator/">Y Combinator startup</a> which has been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/03/with-over-15m-sites-built-weebly-launches-new-planner-and-mobile-editor-brings-website-creation-service-to-android/">rolling out new features</a> and receiving positive reviews.</p>

<p>She registered for Weebly and loved it. I registered as well to check it out, and I was also impressed after creating a draft test website and experimenting with both drag-and-drop UI elements and raw HTML/CSS editing. Since Weebly has Contributor functionality, I was able to edit her website without having to access her account. I made a few CSS tweaks and that was it: I didn&rsquo;t publish my own website on Weebly, as I&rsquo;m very happy with this blog. :)</p>

<p>A day after her website was published, I received an e-mail from Weebly: a generic &ldquo;First Steps to Creating Your Website.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just one email, I think, so I ignore it. And then, the next day, I receive another e-mail that was much less subtle: &ldquo;Your website misses you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is certainly the first time a startup&rsquo;s emails have tried to <em>guilt</em> me into using the service.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>An Email A Day Keeps The Users Away</h1>

<p><img src="/img/weebly1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When I register for <em>any</em> business, not just including startups, I don&rsquo;t enjoy seeing any emails that aren&rsquo;t helpful or aren&rsquo;t expected. I&rsquo;m OK when businesses send emails that alert me when a new service has been launched or when a scheduled newsletter is released. In the former case, the email is directly relevant to my interests, in the latter case, the email is not an unexpected surprise.</p>

<p>In Weebly&rsquo;s case, and any other startup that resorts to forward emailing strategies as a form of &ldquo;growth hacking,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re invalidating my trust. A once-a-month announcement about your business is OK, but if I want to visit your website, I don&rsquo;t need to be reminded every <em>day</em>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the emails that Weebly has sent:</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 5th: First Steps to Creating Your Website</h2>

<p><img src="/img/weebly2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is actually a good first e-mail.</p>

<p>It adds a personal touch. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it since I didn&rsquo;t plan on publishing my own website, but to a new customer, it makes them feel welcome.</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 6th: Your website misses you!</h2>

<p><img src="/img/weebly3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I received this <em>the next day</em> after the previous email. My website misses me? It&rsquo;s been two days! Which you tell me with a rather disturbing amount of precision!</p>

<p>My website is not a cow in FarmVille. I don&rsquo;t need to publish my website immediately. In fact, if I were to publish a website, I would make sure it&rsquo;s polished first, in which case the email&rsquo;s push toward publishing ASAP would actually be insulting.</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 7th: Need Any Help?</h2>

<p><img src="/img/weebly4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a totally-not-automatically-generated e-mail by a employee at Weebly. It lacks any Weebly branding, which supposedly gives it a more &ldquo;personal&rdquo; touch&hellip;except if Richard wanted to give it a personal touch, he would have included <em>my name</em>. The <a href="http://emailmarketing.comm100.com/email-marketing-ebook/can-spam-law.aspx">legally-mandated</a> unsubscribe link, a requirement for commercial emails, doesn&rsquo;t make me feel any more comfortable.</p>

<p>And again, it&rsquo;s only been three days.</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 8th: Max, check out your mobile website!</h2>

<p><img src="/img/weebly5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While that feature may be cool, finding an <em>excuse</em> to send me an e-mail really isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>

<p>Weebly skipped May 9th, fortunately.</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 10th: Free vs. Pro: Which One is Right for You?</h2>

<p><img src="/img/weebly6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>&ldquo;As you may have noticed.&rdquo; In that case, why bother sending the e-mail? Will the e-mail&rsquo;s argument be any different?</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 11th: Max, get 33% off at Weebly!</h2>

<p><img src="/img/weebly7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re mixing both overly precise user registration dates <em>and</em> &ldquo;as you may have noticed&rdquo; verbage! I did notice, as a matter of fact! I noticed <em>yesterday</em>!</p>

<hr>


<h2>May 12th: It&rsquo;s been 8 days, 2 hours, 30 minutes and 6 seconds&hellip;</h2>

<p><img src="/img/weebly8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ok, seriously, what the hell?</p>

<p>At this point, Weebly is seriously <em>threatening</em> me into publishing my website. Gone are the informative email subject lines: now, Weebly simply <em>reminds</em> me how much time I&rsquo;ve spent not working on a website. They&rsquo;ve graduated from passive-aggressive to just aggressive.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s genuinely terrifying is that Weebly actually created a custom email message to send to users to send after a week of having an unpublished site. <em>They tested this email behavior and thought this was a good idea.</em> Apparently, they never considered that a user could exist solely to contribute to another user&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>Some might say that I should have unsubscribed if I was unhappy with Weebly&rsquo;s emails. Indeed, all the e-mails had unsubscribe links, hidden where most people won&rsquo;t see them of course. But that&rsquo;s not the point: if startups keep sending forward e-mails, <em>everyone</em> loses.</p>

<p>At the least, I&rsquo;m very cautious to recommend Weebly to anyone else.</p>

<hr>


<p><strong>UPDATE (5/14/13)</strong>: On the corresponding <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5704860">Hacker News thread</a>, David Rusenko, founder and CEO of Weebly, posted a response:</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d like to jump in and clarify a few things. First, we have recently been testing the frequency of our email sending, and the author seems to have been bucketed into the &ldquo;more frequent&rdquo; group. That being said, we were actually planning on reducing the frequency of what we emailed the author by roughly 25%, including eliminating the &ldquo;Your website misses you&rdquo; and the &ldquo;It’s been 8 days, 2 hours, 30 minutes and 6 seconds…&rdquo; emails, among others. I just fast-tracked this and it&rsquo;s now live, so our email volume when you sign up is now much lower.</p>

<p>Second, we put a lot of effort into trying to send personalized email communication that is specific to your use case, but it looks like we missed a very important group, contributors to others' sites. This was a mistake. These emails may make sense if you were starting your own site, but they certainly don&rsquo;t make sense if you were just contributing to someone else&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m going to make sure we revise that set of emails within 2 weeks to something more appropriate and even less frequent.</p>

<p>Last, as many here are correct to assume, we are constantly testing and refining our email communications. I think it&rsquo;s helpful to understand our customer&rsquo;s psychology when they are signing up for Weebly, it is instructive in understanding our thought process and why we send the emails we do.
Most of our customers (60%) consider themselves entrepreneurs. They are bringing a new idea to life, things like chairigami.com, themintspace.com, stealthelectricbikesusa.com or weeknightbite.com. They are quitting their full-time jobs to do this and it&rsquo;s a very frightening process.</p>

<p>Creating their site is especially daunting and difficult for them, even though it&rsquo;s so crucial to their success. Many of them start the process, want to finish, but give up. We&rsquo;ve found that the first week is the most crucial. In our email communications, it&rsquo;s our goal to try to help them across the finish line to a high-quality site.</p>

<p>In this case, we were emailing too often, and we&rsquo;ve stopped doing that. In general, most of our users do appreciate some help and encouragement along the way, and we will keep testing emails to try to make that as effective, helpful, and non-annoying as possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to hear that Weebly is aware of the issue, and I&rsquo;m thankful for David&rsquo;s response, although I&rsquo;ll still be keeping an eye on the close eye on how much spam they&rsquo;re still sending out.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/01/sexy-will-haunt-your-dreams/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-15T21:36:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/01/sexy-will-haunt-your-dreams</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>TechCrunch writer Sarah Perez recently wrote <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/15/lost-on-new-myspace-cant-escape-justin-send-help/">an incredibly hilarious article</a> about <a href="https://new.myspace.com/">Myspace</a>&rsquo;s recent redesign, and the&hellip;overemphasis of a certain former N'Sync band member. Justin Timberlake, the spearhead of Myspace&rsquo;s music-oriented redesign, stresses his clean-shaven image with a handsome yet somber black-and-white portrait that always seems to follow you where you go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m OK with this. There are certainly far <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/03/ethics-self-promotion/"><em>worse</em></a> ways to promote a startup.</p>

<p>His moody yet charmful face adds a touch of class to any website. But why does he have to stay constrained to Myspace? Why not let Justin Timberlake dominate the world?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>No Such Thing As Too Much Sexy</h2>

<p>If you are reading this post on a desktop or laptop, you&rsquo;ll see a handsome fellow in the lower-right corner. This is Justin Timberlake of the Mickey Mouse Club. Say hi.</p>

<p>Using the power of the Stylish extension for Chrome and Firefox, Mr. Timberlake has already made his mark on many startups around the internet.</p>

<p><img src="/img/justintest3.png"></p>

<p><img src="/img/justintest2.png"></p>

<p><img src="/img/justintest9.png"></p>

<p><img src="/img/justintest8.png"></p>

<p><img src="/img/justintest7.png"></p>

<p><img src="/img/justintest5.png"></p>

<p><img src="/img/justintest4.png"></p>

<p>To accomplish this magic, I use the Stylish browser extension, which can be used with either <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Firefox</a>. I have used Stylish <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/12/powerpoint-promo-party/">before, with browser filters</a>, and it worked very well. If you want your own moody Justin, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the Stylish extension for your browser.</li>
<li>In the extension preferences, go to &ldquo;Managed Installed Styles&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Write New Style&rdquo;</li>
<li><p>Paste this CSS code in the &ldquo;Code&rdquo; textbox:</p>

<pre><code>body, ._li, .main {
background-image: url(http://i.imgur.com/UN5HE.png) !important;
background-position: right bottom !important;
background-repeat: no-repeat !important;
background-attachment: fixed !important;
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>And you&rsquo;re done! Justin will appear pretty much everywhere. Yes, there are a lot of <em>!important</em> declarations, but Justin Timberlake is an important man.</p>

<p>In fact, by using the HTML snippet in this <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/display-justin-timberlake-sexiness">GitHub repository</a>, you can add Justin to your own site!</p>

<p>Feel free to narrow down the domains where Justin appears by using Stylish as necessary. Although, why would you do such a thing!?</p>

<h2>Taking Justin To The Next Level</h2>

<p><img src="/img/816440400_1965379.gif"></p>

<p>Now that we can make Justin appear anywhere, let&rsquo;s put his power to good use. TechCrunch writer Alexia Tsostis recently made a post about the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/16/were-bringing-techcrunch-back/">upcoming redesign of TechCrunch</a>, which, I admit, is long overdue.</p>

<p>In the post, Alexia spoils that the redesign will include lots of sparkles. And a picture of the Justin-man himself. Above is a mockup made by Chris Velazco, another TechCrunch writer, and it is indeed marvelous. (except for the lack of a comments section!)</p>

<p>But why wait for the redesign? We have Timberlake Technology. We can do it <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Using the power of Stylish, I present to you, a sneak peek into TechCrunch&rsquo;s 2013 redesign.</p>

<p>I made a <em>few</em> stylistic additions as well. It&rsquo;s magic.</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/j6m2pjjhnuU "></iframe></div></p>

<p>You can find a copy of the CSS I used to emulate this wonderful layout in <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/techcrunch-1999">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Will you let Timberlake enrich <em>your</em> life? He&rsquo;s waiting. In the lower-right corner of your screen.</p>

    <link href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/01/if-cute-then-happiness/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-13T21:32:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://minimaxir.com/2013/01/if-cute-then-happiness</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>TL;DR: Use this <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/74285">IFTTT recipe</a>, and change the subreddit value in the parameter of the Feed URL as needed.</em></strong></p>

<p>In <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2012/12/totally-real-totally-serious/">a previous post</a>, I joked about a hypothetical social media strategy in which an automated script does Facebook brand management by stealing the top cute images from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> &ndash; an aggregator of trending topics and images &ndash;  and reposting them on the Facebook page, additionally adding a cute message encouraging users to LIKE, SHARE, and COMMENT!  We get easy social media fame for no monetary cost.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I wanted to see if it was feasible to create such a script. Both Reddit and Facebook indeed have APIs that make it easy. But then I have to set up a server to check Reddit periodically, ensure that no images are duplicated, etc., and that can take time to implement and ensure that it works correctly (<em>all</em> the images must be cute!). I looked into <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, a relatively new startup that talks between different popular web services to automate simple tasks, like posting to Twitter whenever you post to Facebook.</p>

<p>As it turns out, yes, this is possible, and you can also save the top images on Reddit to your computer via any cloud storage service without ever visiting the website too! Just use <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/74285">this IFTTT recipe</a>! There are a few interesting caveats, though&hellip;</p>

<h2>Really Simple Syndication is&hellip;Really Simple?</h2>

<p>IFTTT allows users to extract information from RSS feeds, which one might typically be used to read blogs and news articles. The RSS feed typically provides the title, author, date, and content of a post: the important things. However, RSS has more applications: it can distribute other data, such as weather and desktop wallpapers. IFTTT allows other apps to load image and audio files from an RSS feed, but only if the RSS feed link links to the content itself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this won&rsquo;t work on Reddit by default, as its RSS feeds do not contain a direct link to the photo and instead link to the Reddit comments on the image. Image-based websites, such as <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a> and <a href="http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper/downloads/date/any/">InterfaceLift</a> also implement a similar system because they don&rsquo;t want their users just to use a script to download images and bypass the website and its lovely revenue-generating advertisements. Therefore, the RSS feed alone won&rsquo;t work with IFTTT.</p>

<p>During my research into my social media exploitation hypothesis, I found a <a href="http://blog.stevemould.com/rss-feed-reddit-stories-score-threshold/">blog post by Steve Mould</a> that provides a way to translate data from Reddit&rsquo;s JSON API to an RSS feed using a service called <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a>. This modified RSS feed, when given a subreddit and a score threshold, obtains the top Reddit posts in that subreddit above that karma threshold (upvotes &ndash; downvotes), and returns a feed item which contains direct link to the referenced URL.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://bit.ly/W1ypdf">my variation of his Reddit Pipe</a>. My script to process the API has a few changes (such as using Reddit&rsquo;s &ldquo;hot&rdquo; posts, instead of the top posts; hot posts update much more frequently). Testing it with r/aww and a threshold of 50 karma, I received 177 very cute pictures on my computer in a week.</p>

From that Pipe, you can get the data in a RSS feed URL. Right-click and copy that feed URL into a IFTTT recipe as the source. For the action, use the <strong></strong> variable to retrieve the image URL.</p>

<h2>With Great Power Comes Great Cuteness</h2>

<p>Yes, you can save the Reddit images to your computer automatically using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. Or <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>. Or <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/">SkyDrive</a>. Or even get a cute email every hour!</p>

<p>Thanks to IFTTT, there are many other creative things you can do with the feed that you can include in a recipe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto-post the image to your Tumblr or WordPress blog. Easy cuteness, and you&rsquo;ll be the source!</li>
<li>Auto-curate the cute photos to your Facebook or Twitter account. All your friends will love you!</li>
<li>Get social media fame for no additional monetary cost by publishing the cute images to your Facebook Page, with an encouragement to LIKE SHARE and COMMENT! My original hypothesis was correct!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>One caveat in using Yahoo Pipes is that it is rate limited to 200 runs in a 10 minute interval, meaning that the IFTTT recipe provided will likely fail if more than 200 people use the feed. If that does happen, just clone my pipe, and use the RSS feed from the clone for your own personal recipe.</p>

<p>Also, there&rsquo;s no rate limiting on when recipes are triggered and images are posted/downloaded. You can trigger multiple images simultaneously, which may be considered spammy if you are posting to social media. In that case, increase the karma threshold to reduce the frequency of the postings and to maintain a high quality of the images.</p>

Getting socially-vetted photos on your computer without any effort is a useful timesaver. A solution to a first world problem, perhaps, but it&rsquo;s the little things that count!</p>
