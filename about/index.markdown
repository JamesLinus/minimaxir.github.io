Minimaxir is a blog by Max Woolf about startups, technology, and blogging. It's so meta, [even this acronym][2].

Max Woolf is a Software QA Engineer living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 2 years. He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2012 with a degree in Business Administration, concentrating in Computing and Information Technology.

In his spare time, Max uses Python to gather data from public APIs and ggplot2 to make pretty charts from that data. Max also comments on technology blogs rather frequently.

# History of Minimaxir #

Max has had a fondness for both the internet and technology since 10-years old, despite 56k internet speed and [COPPA][3] limiting access to pretty much every website at the time. Throughout his teenage years, Max was a fan of online gaming, with services such as Xbox Live and MMOs such as World of Warcraft (but he made sure schoolwork came first!). Around 2006, Max began reading tech blogs such as [Engadget][4], and found that commenting on blogs was a fun sport. Unfortunately, he had neither the technical knowledge nor the money to run a blog of his own.

In May 2010, Minimaxir, a word meaning "to be the best you can be," was first established by Max as a WordPress blog about technology and the internet (which was possible mostly due to the fact that [Dreamhost][5] had a sweet website hosting discount at the time). Since blogs about technology and the internet were not unique in any way, absolutely no one visited Minimaxir. In the meantime, Max had noticed that rival blogging platforms such as [Tumblr][6] and [Blogger][7] did not easily allow users to share posts via social networks and also did not natively support a decent comment system, both of which can contribute to the success of a blog via word-of-mouth. Max, in what was known as the "laziest start-up implementation ever," decided to repurpose Minimaxir as a "blogging platform" by tweaking WordPress to allow any user to post on the blog; their posts would be supplemented by the typical Facebook/Twitter buttons, and bloggers could easily communicate with readers with [Disqus][8]. Unfortunately, the revamp did not succeed because the targeted userbase already had a Tumblr/Blogger and did not want to switch. Also, the website ran terribly since it required about 40 WordPress plugins for all the necessary functionality.

In October 2011, Minimaxir was relaunched by Max, now having a better grasp on both technology strategy within business and also how to build websites that do not suck. Max hopes to continue posting on Minimaxir as frequently as possible about the latest happenings within both the technology industry and also the internet startup subculture.

In March 2012, Minimaxir was designed with a new, more professional theme that follows recent trends in web development, such as responsive layouts and drop shadows everywhere. In December 2012, it was again redesigned to be more minimalistic and light-weight.

In May 2013, Dreamhost killed the blog, so he migrated to Jekyll and Github Pages. In November 2013, he did a major redesign to a style inspired by that of modern startups.

In September 2014, Max did another redesign with a more neutral color pallete to put more emphasis on the pretty charts.
