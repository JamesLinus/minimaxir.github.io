If you've been on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/), you may have noticed that many link submissions go to "imgur.com". [Imgur](http://imgur.com/), an image hosting service that launched on Reddit a few years ago and has seen outstanding growth ever since, even [surpassing Reddit itself](http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/26/imgur-traffic-milestone-100m-uniques/).

But how many of Reddit's many, many links are actually links to Imgur? As it turns out, Imgur, along with YouTube, account for *32%* of the links submitted to Reddit.

Using Reddit's API, I have downloaded about 5 million link submissions from Reddit, accounting for nearly two months of activity from July 22nd to September 26th. I complied a list of the most-frequent link destination domains for the links submitted anywhere on Reddit. The results were interesting.

The imgur domains (i.imgur.com and imgur.com) account for **23.7%** of all links submitted to Reddit, and the YouTube domains (youtube.com and youtu.be) account for **8.2%** of all links.

Two websites account for **32%** of all links submitted to Reddit (i.e. 1 in every 3 submitted links go to Imgur or YouTube), and no other website is remotely close. Not the meme sites, not the music sites, not the news sites, not the *porn* sites: Reddit is images and video.

But *where* on Reddit are the Imgur and YouTube links most prominent?

Here's a chart of the top subreddits, by percentage of all  Imgur links submitted on Reddit:

It's interesting to note how the *funny* subreddit has more Imgur links than the *pics* subreddit.

For YouTube, and the percentage of all YouTube links submitted on Reddit by subreddit:

*Videos* wins as you might expect, but *Music* is in second place. Along with *listentothis*, 
*Metal*, and *hiphopheads*, YouTube is the de facto website for *music* as well as video. Gaming is also  very popular with YouTube links, with *gaming*, *leagueoflegends*, and *Minecraft*.

Images and video are the backbone of Reddit, and both Imgur and YouTube are the primary sources. Although, there appears to be a nontrivial demand for pure music websites such as [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) and gaming video websites such as [Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) ...could there be another big success story in the making?
