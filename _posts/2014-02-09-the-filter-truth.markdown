Most [Instagram](http://instagram.com/) photos have filters applied to make them look more retro/cool. Instagram users are also able to apply tags to a photo to help categorize and promote them to the Instagram community. One such tag, #nofilter, is intended to emphasize such natural beauty that no filter is necessary to enhance the image. (or the photographer is just too lazy to decide on a filter)

But how many #nofilter images actually *have* no filter?

As it turns not, not all of them.

After retrieving about 50,000 images through the Instagram API (code [available on GitHub](https://github.com/minimaxir/get-data-from-photos-from-instagram-tags)), here is the breakdown of filters on #nofilter-tagged Instagram images:

Only 83% of #nofilter images have no filter?! You had one job, Instagram! :(

*The actual reason that this is happening is because Instagram rewards #tagspamming. More on that in a future blog post.*
