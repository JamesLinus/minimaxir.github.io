      <h1 class="link"><a href="/2011/11/how-startups-make-money/">How Startups Make Money: Do They *Need* A Revenue Model?</a></h1>
      <p>Startups. The biggest movement in the technology world since the beginning of the 20th century. Never has it been so easy for teams of entrepreneurs, or even individuals, to create a business from scratch. The barrier of entry has been virtually eliminated thanks to the advent of cloud computing services, such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>, which allow businesses to only spend hundreds of dollars for server infrastructure for databases and processing where, only a few years ago, entrepreneurs would normally spend tens of thousands for the same capabilities, and thousands more in upkeep and maintenance. Yes, <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2011/11/like-x-for-y/" title="Startups, Please Stop Saying You’re “Like X for Y”">I’ve said these words before</a>, but the lack of significant upkeep costs is a significant factor in startup economics.</p>

<p>Businesses thrive when they have a positive net profit. For any business, profit can be measured by taking total revenue and subtracting total cost. Because total cost for startups is much lower due to the aforementioned cloud services, they can have a proportionally lower revenue and still hold significant profit margins. This allows them to more easily prove that their business is successful and lends the startup credibility when they attempt to expand by asking for venture capital. At the least, your business needs to make enough money to cover employee expenses, which is one reason why startups go “lean” and have less than 10 employees to save on costs.</p>

<p>But what’s the best way for startups to make money? Investors in your startup want to earn their capital back at some point in time, after all.There’s the tried-and-true method of getting customers to use your service, then charging a subscription fee. However, there are many startups, such as <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a>, a photo sharing service, that have no current method of earning money from consumers! (Instagram <a href="http://instagr.am/about/faq/">says outright </a>that they have no revenue model! Most impressive use of transparency ever.) Is that business model, or lack thereof, sustainable?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/14/i-got-five-on-it/"><img src="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/14/i-got-five-on-it/" alt="If you click the image to go to Instagram, you make them spend $0.0001 in bandwidth too!" /></a></p>

<p>Dave McClure, a very successful investor, states that<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/14/i-got-five-on-it/"> his five criteria for investing in startups</a> are: Market, Product, Team, Customers, and Revenue. Revenue and Customers are two distinct points, even though an increase in customers implies an increase in revenue. Can startups forgo a revenue model if they compensate by having a killer product and team, and targeting the right market and obtain lots of customers?</p>

<p>99% of startups need a reliable, effective way to make money, or else they’ll go out of business. But for the remaining 1% who have an incredible product and team, they can defy the principles of microeconomics and manage to succeed without an explicit way of obtaining revenue.<br/>
First, let’s look at how internet startups typically make money in 2011:</p>

<p><strong>1. Advertisement Revenue (<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>):</strong> The oldest, and still best, way of making money on the internet. Pioneered by Google with their AdWords platform in the 2000’s, where relevant advertisements accompanied internet searches, Google earned $billions and billions in revenue each year, and became the technology juggernaut it is today. Even individuals who are not creating a business, such as bloggers, can earn revenue on their own blogs by implementing an ad distribution network such as Google AdSense. Large scale startups and professional blogs, however, cut out the middle-man and distribute the ads themselves, which allows them to earn even more money.</p>

<p><strong>2. Free/Premium Tiered Subscription Models (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>)</strong>: Subscriptions for services have existed well before the internet, with newspapers and gym memberships, and even with software such as shareware. However, due to the decreasing costs of IT from cloud computing, the cost per user is neligible, so startups can feasibly give away their entire service for free. This free service can be used to tempt the consumer into buying a premium version of the service with added perks; the revenue from a user paying for a subscription far outweighs the additional cost of the perks. Dropbox is one of the pioneers of this strategy: they offer 2GB of cloud storage space for free (which costs them less than $0.001/user), and users can pay $10/month for 50GB of space (which only costs them slightly more than $0.001).</p>

<p><strong>3. Freemium (<a href="http://company.zynga.com/">Zynga</a>)</strong>: Similar to #2, freemium is where the service is completely free, and customers can pay for perks or additional content <em>a la carte</em>. Zynga is the pioneer here with games such as FarmVille, where players can always play for free, but only for a certain amount of time; paying real money can help speed things up. It’s not my favorite business model; wayyy too many gaming startups, especially on the PC (<a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">League of Legends</a>, <a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2</a>) and iOS (everything in the Top Grossing section of the App Store), use this model, but it’s simple, effective, and down to an exact science. Many users are willing-to-pay for an advantage, and many aren’t; freemium caters to both of those types of users.</p>

<p>Most internet services will use one of these models, or some combination thereof. <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> and <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a>, for example, uses #1 to earn revenue off of free users, but offer a premium service to exploit #2. There are exceptions for the more niche startups (i.e. which offer a physical product/services or use brand merchandising), but in general, the three models are safest for a startup, especially since all three are easily scalable.</p>

<p>Let’s look back at Instagram. Could they implement one of the three mentioned revenue models? Easily. Ads could be shown to the user on the iOS client or beside the picture on the web, although adding ads to a previously ad-free app usually upsets customers. Instagram could charge a subscription fee  or an in-app purchase for premium filters, however “high-quality photo filters” is an oxymoron, and might not succeed in user adoption.</p>

<p>It’s highly likely that Instagram <em>doesn’t intend to monetize itself at all</em>, and instead use the product as a springboard for much better, larger things. Anyone in the Silicon Valley can make a product, but very few people can make good products, and very few startups are as popular as Instagram in recent months.</p>

<p><a href="http://belugapods.com/">Beluga</a> was a startup that specialized in mobile chatting. It was later <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/01/facebook-beluga/">bought by Facebook</a>, and their team was folded into the company and helped develop the Facebook Messager app for mobile. <a href="http://groupme.com/">GroupMe</a> was another social solution, which was later<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/21/skype-to-acquire-year-old-group-messaging-service-groupme/"> bought by Skype</a>. Both startups received multi-million dollar buyouts.</p>

<p>In 2011, positioning yourself for a buyout by a multibillion dollar corporation is a legitimate exit strategy. Yes, there’s a considerable amount of risk involved because there’s no certainty that someone will buy your startup. However, if the startup first builds a  large userbase, larger companies will certainly take note, and in some cases, buy you out just to take your users as their own.</p>

<p>Instagram has many options, to be sure. Should startups follow in their foot steps? Well, obviously they should try to create an excellent product with an excellent team. But can the typical startup pull off having no revenue model? I would not recommend it. The off chance of a buyout or investment support drastically outweighs the inability to pay your employees and maintain your servers five or ten years down the road.</p>

<p>If you’re making a startup in 2011, make sure it has a way to make money. There are many tried and true methods, pick the one(s) which best fit your business model! If the opportunity hits to make it big, don’t neglect it, but be pragmatic and realistic with your expectations.</p>

      <p>Startups. The biggest movement in the technology world since the beginning of the 20th century. Never has it been so easy for teams of entrepreneurs, or even individuals, to create a business from scratch. The barrier of entry has been virtually eliminated thanks to the advent of cloud computing services, such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>, which allow businesses to only spend hundreds of dollars for server infrastructure for databases and processing where, only a few years ago, entrepreneurs would normally spend tens of thousands for the same capabilities, and thousands more in upkeep and maintenance. Therefore, more and more tech companies now have the ability to bring their ideas to fruition, and afterwards they will compete in the most vicious and cutthroat marketplace ever: the Internet.</p>

<p>With so many new companies entering the tech marketplace, it is very difficult for an individual startup to stand out from the crowd. Product differentiation is the key tenant: how is your startup different from your competitors? Would customers be willing to discard the time and effort they’ve already invested in a similar product to switch to your product?</p>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/31/500-startups-peels-back-the-curtain-on-its-third-and-largest-batch-yet/"><img src="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/31/500-startups-peels-back-the-curtain-on-its-third-and-largest-batch-yet/" alt="...until it's lost." /></a></p>

<p>Of course, if your product is <em>truly</em> 100% innovative, that would not be a problem. Alas, true innovation in the Silicon Valley has been stagnant; most products and services have been slight tweaks of existing business models (Google%2B from Facebook; Spotify from every Internet music service ever). That’s not necessarily a bad thing: in order to think outside the box, you must first define the box, in order to determine what is inside the box, and consequently what is outside the box. And this “outside the box” innovation can introduce an aspect which the company can differentiate itself, and become incredibly successful.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Such innovation, however, is very expensive, very time-consuming, and very risky. Much more expensive and risky than an individual or a group of people simply creating an account at Amazon and publishing some PHP and jQuery. And so, startups tend to target more simple, safer issues, such as “What are big companies missing?” Necessity is the mother of invention, after all.</p>

<p>A very common pitch for a company is that it’s “Like X for Y.” As demonstrated by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/31/500-startups-peels-back-the-curtain-on-its-third-and-largest-batch-yet/">this TechCrunch post</a>, there are many up-and-coming startups who, for example, bill themselves as “Instagram for Yelp” or <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110909/loku-wants-to-beat-yelp-and-google-at-local-search-with-some-help-from-big-data/">another company</a> that bills itself as “like Google for local.” Advertising shtick from a 90’s movie trailer, natch.</p>

<p>However, marketing your new business with such a focus is an incredible business liability because it’s condescending to your prospective userbase, it could potentially confuse your users, and it gives the companies you’re referencing a potential use case that they could use to wipe you out completely.</p>

<p>It’s safe to assume that the average person knows atleast a few major businesses on the internet. They might know about services such as <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>, <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. That’s what makes them an compelling target: sure, they might use or know about those services, but what if they want something different? I’m sure you’ve seen the endless posts that occur when Facebook undergoes a redesign, and the numerous threats that users will quit Facebook unless they revert the changes.  Sure, Facebook users adapt and forget the whole thing happened, but dissent is a great opportunity for a startup to position itself in an established market. (See the <a href="http://xkcd.com/918/">XKCD</a> comic above; Google knows when to release their products!)
In 2011, it’s also safe to assume that the users who would be interested in your startup aren’t idiots. Learning how to use the full functionality of Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare is just like learning calculus or a programming language: it’s straightforward and somewhat intuitive, until you learn that they all have annoying little exceptions to their rules, and you need to know when and where they occur. (and in the case of programming languages, actual Exceptions.) Many industries, especially music and movies, tend to appeal to the lowest common denominator because they don’t care if the money earned is from a dumbo or a genius; dollars are dollars. On the Internet, where most business are selling services instead of products, users cannot be treated like idiots. Customers retention is one of the most important metrics for ensuring the growth of a startup, especially those with subscription or freemium revenue models, because it ensures that the revenue per customer is high, and therefore the company can safely increase scale and grow</p>

<p>Your customers don’t need to be told that your business is “Like <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a> for <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>.” If your prospective userbase knows what Instagram and Yelp are, you can assume they can reasonably infer that comparison upon simply knowing that the service is “simple sharing for restaurant reviews.” Internet-dwellers are much smarter than some companies give them credit. At best, it doesn’t add anything to your marketing pitch. At worst, comparing your product to an already existing company can be dishonest marketing hyperbole, making your company seem more impressive than it is. (“Instagram for Yelp” particularly doesn’t make any sense. I thought Instragram was primarily used for photo filter abuse, not for ease of sharing!)</p>

<p>The comments in the aforementioned TechCrunch article pointed out that the “Like X for Y” basis works well for investors. It is indeed the easiest way to explain your business in few words, and venture capitalists have limited amounts of time to hear investment requests from each and every startup. However, easiest does not mean best. If I was an investor and a company began its presentation to a group of venture capitalists stating “our business is like Google for local,” I wouldn’t know what to think. Is it a search engine for local areas? Is it a hub to the internet with e-mail and RSS syndication with a streamlined UI intended primarily for local communities? Is it a company that’s just boasting about how awesome it is? Of course, it’s the first one, but there should be zero ambiguity when illustrating the underlying principles of the business that will [hopefully] make millions of dollars.</p>

<p>More importantly, if you can’t explain your business in simple terms with investors, how can you possibly explain it to your potential users? Sure, your investors are giving you money in the short term, but your users are far more important, and will give you many, many times that amount throughout the lifetime of your business.</p>

<p>For startups targeting a particular niche, your market is not the average user, but the userbase of the niche, who may not be as tech-savvy as others (for example, business that target Generation X/Y instead of teenagers and young adults who have grown up with the Internet). Consequently, you might confuse your potential users by using a simile to describe your business, if they aren’t likely to know the business at all. Look at “<a href="http://www.gilt.com/">Gilt</a> for Weddings.” That product is targeting a specific niche because it has a very narrow use. But what is Gilt? It’s apparently the “darling of luxury-obsessed bargain hunters,” but would those who know about Gilt also want that service for weddings? In actuality, the service is just a shop for cheap wedding dresses. Admittingly I’m not in the target market because I’m a guy. [Note: The founder of the service pointed out in the TechCrunch article comments that yes, their target market knows what Gilt, and therefore the comparison is simple and accurate. Again, would brides want “bargain” wedding dresses?]</p>

<p>Another weakness marketing your product to a specific niche is that the existing company, who likely has much more resources than your startup, can simply copy your idea, and wipe you out of business because you haven’t had a chance to diversify. Look at <a href="http://twitpic.com/">TwitPic</a>, one of the first services to allow users to easily post images to Twitter. It targeted a very specific, very important need, and it was very successful. A few years later, Twitter<a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2011/08/09/twitter-now-rolling-out-direct-image-upload-at-twitter-com/"> implemented native picture uploading</a> to its official Twitter clients. And thus, since the company did not diversify, TwitPic was forced to slowly fade into obscurity. (the founder, Noah Everett, hilariously attempted to stage a counterattack by creating <a href="https://heello.com/">Heello</a>…a clone of Twitter in every way. That’ll show them!)</p>

<p>Business that exist solely by leveraging an APIs from large companies such as Facebook or Twitter, allowing startups to access and manipulate data from those users, are a risky proposition. On one hand, the fate of the startup is now tied to the company in a symbiotic bond. Look at <a href="http://company.zynga.com/">Zynga</a>, makers of Farmville, who had to admit <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/01/zynga-and-facebook-pray-they-dont-alter-the-deal-any-further/">in their filing for an IPO</a> that “If Facebook goes under, so do we,” and have only recently begun precautions to guard against this incredible risk factor.</p>

<p>Many, many startups are founded by those with technical computer science backgrounds, as they are the ones who can both identify a problem/need in the technical space, and implement the solution. Usually, they do not have an immediate background in business nor have learned the skills needed needed to make a product succeed (marketing, finance, etc.), and startups cannot afford hiring a CEO with an MBA without money from venture capitalists. This can create a Catch-22 situation: startups can’t create a business-aligned strategy until they can prove to investors that they can create a business-aligned strategy. Sure, you can code the Web 2.0 app of awesomeness, but so can a million other people. Without the proper investment in balancing the books, getting your product known, and most importantly, product differentiation, you won’t have a chance to succeed. In lieu of business skills, entrepreneurs simply follow what other startups have done: target your niche, and prosper.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs who are creating startups in 2011 do not have <em>any</em> leeway in their product implementation and promotion: they need to strike the market viciously, otherwise they will be swallowed up by the competition in an instant. It’s fair for entrepreneurs to learn business skills as they create their business, <em>a la</em> Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, but without knowing <em>why</em> certain marketing strategies are bad for business and <em>why</em> product differentiation is so important, their startups won’t be able to get off the ground, and, tragically, they won’t have the ability to make a difference in the world.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/2011/10/blog-commenting-2011/">Blog Commenting in 2011</a></h1>
      <p>One of the most important things about blogs is having a comment section. Not only does it allow the blogs reader the ability to participate in discussions about similar topics, but it also offers a medium which the author can communicate with the readers themselves. This allows authors to get feedback from readers regarding what they like about your post, what they think of your posts, and how to improve your blog in general. Also, you get spam. It &rsquo;s not an authentic blog without it.</p>

<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/minimaxir.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/blogger.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/minimaxir.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/blogger.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Sure, blog comment sections have been around since the dawn of blogs themselves, and nowadays creating a blog comments section is the “Hello World!” of web development. However, most blogging platforms, such as Tumblr, Blogger, native WordPress installs offer rudimentary commenting; you input a name and a comment, press “post comment,” and then you &rsquo;re done. As you can see above, Blogger just lists a name and comment, and it &rsquo;s been that way since 2004, and no one has seen a “need” to improve it. But in 2011, with the advent of persistent identities due to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, it &rsquo;s very archaic to have to enter your name and email every time you just want to leave a comment on a blog. It &rsquo;s not a matter of being lazy/Generation-X, it &rsquo;s a matter of whether the cost of having to reinput your information a million times just to post a comment outweighs the benefits of doing so. And if everyone feels that way, it becomes a “chicken” problem: no one comments because others don &rsquo;t comment, blogs gets less readers/feedback, everyone loses.</p>

<p>In 2011, if your blog does not have some sort of easily accessible commenting system, then your blog is in serious trouble.</p>

<p> <!-- more --></p>

<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/minimaxir.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/disqus2.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/minimaxir.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/disqus2.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>A large stride toward easier blog commenting occurred in 2007 with Disqus, a startup whose sole purpose was to create a system for blog comments. The blogger can install Disqus by registering for an account, then install a plugin or put some HTML code on a webpage; none of which difficult for even the most computer illiterate. Users can create a Disqus account using their Facebook, Twitter, or Google credentials, with just two button clicks. After creating a Disqus account for use on a website, you can use that account to comment on any other website that has installed Disqus.  The more blogs that use Disqus, the more time you save, and thus the more inclined you will be to comment on blogs! As a result of these things, Disqus grew rapidly in popularity, and became used by huge, 1M%2B/month viewer blogs as Engadget. (A competitor did enter at around the same time named IntenseDebate, and had essentially the same functionality as Disqus. Except Disqus was adopted first, and so IntenseDebate lost and no one uses it nowadays. The technology world is cruel like that.)</p>

<p>A couple years later, Facebook released their own commenting system, not as a competitor to Disqus, but as another method to keep people on the internet far longer than they need to be. Facebook actually makes it easier for bloggers to implement because registering an account for admin use is optional! For users, Facebook tops Disqus in that it takes <strong>zero</strong> clicks to be able to comment on a Facebook Comments section: you &rsquo;re logged into Facebook, bam, you can comment.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the use of Disqus and Facebook Comments lead to something unexpected: it increased the <em>quality</em> of the comments! Not only were users happier because they didn &rsquo;t need to register, but their comments were now tied to their real identity. In fact, it will also list your occupation by your name, which lends a large amount of authority to your comments, especially if you work at a Fortune 500 company or are a CEO. People will [hopefully] not troll or spam comments when their comments can be directly traced by clicking their picture. Both systems also incorporate a “Like” feature which most basic comment systems lack, which also incentivizes users to post higher-quality comments as well.</p>

<p>At the least, knowing you are chatting with a real person in the comments makes a big different. The use of Facebook profile pictures with the comments helps more than you might think.</p>

<p>I know many bloggers who don &rsquo;t see a need to modify the comments system: “if it ain &rsquo;t broke, don &rsquo;t fit it” after all. What they don &rsquo;t realize is that blogging is a two-way street: it &rsquo;s a <em>rapport</em> between the bloggers and the readers, and one has no reason to exist without the other. If bloggers make their reader happy, the readers will be happier to help the bloggers. Just saving a few seconds for your readers will pay off incredible dividends in the future.</p>

<p>Fortunately, WordPress.com, one of the largest free blog platforms, is now making the push toward a single sign-on solution, as evidenced above, by allowing blog owners on that platform to allow readers to comment with their Facebook or Twitter credentials. In fact, it &rsquo;s enabled by default, unlike most WordPress installations. This is a big step, and hopefully other bloggers will be able to see hands-on the benefits of allowing easier commenting. Also, it leads to much higher quality commenting, and less spam and trolling.</p>

<p>Commenting is such a huge part of the blogging experience for both bloggers and readers, and I speak from years of experience.</p>

<p><em>(PS: It &rsquo;s worth nothing that Automattic, the company that owns WordPress.com, also owns IntenseDebate. Why didn &rsquo;t they vertically integrate IntenseDebate into WordPress.com, and then get massive users via the same network effects that made Disqus popular? That alone would have killed Disqus!)</em></p>
